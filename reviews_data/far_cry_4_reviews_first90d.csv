14231736,76561198140287102,"'Looks like Far Cry 3' . Believe me its much better. Trying to find all those lost letters, MG journals and masks; discovering all ?s, it is amazing exploration experience. If you wanna do something crazy, try the Shanath Arena at hardest difficulty, it may seem easy at the beginning, but as you reach the higher levels, final rounds become totally vicious.
Hunting is hard mostly, except you are using a signature (Buzzsaw for example makes it sooo easy)
Bell towers are guarded in Northern Kyrat (some are heavily) and quite challenging to reach the top.
Outposts are not that easy to liberate. Fortresses turn into high quality action movie if you are noticed by your enemies, even the dogs.
Hunters are dangerous. It is great to have a sneaky enemy like that.
Eagles, rhinos, demon fishes and honeybadgers are completely annoying, but it makes the game even better.
You can ride an elephant and bash your enemies. 
Only thing annoying for me is distance optimization. That map cannot be 8k meters from one end to the other. It is at least 20k and distance is shown correctly if it is short but long distances are totally incorrect.
If I could explore himalayas as much as I did in Kyrat and distances were correctly calculated, this game would be 10/10.
Now it is 9/10 as they release DLC missions in Himalayas.
Hunting, bomb defusing, eye for an eye, assasination,armed escort and golden path supplies missions are also great but nothing extraordinary (except hunting for supplies)
Characters except Ajay (I did not like him, Jason Brody would be amazing in this game) are nearly perfect.
Far Cry is an idea of letting you explore the new world they created in every single aspect. If you love open world games that does not come to an end easily, this is the game you've been looking for. Trust me!

14229304,76561198011984060,"If you liked FC3, this game is for you. If you diddn't like FC3, Well i think the choice is obvious.

The story is garbage, apperantly it was written when people still thought ISIS were brave rebels fighting the evil syrian government, so basically you fight FOR indian ISIS. The individual rebels are pretty nice guys, but the generals Amita and Sabal are both tools. It's a real bummer you can'r Rebel and take down the golden path. The radio host is pretty annoying too. He keeps dickriding obama, and telling us that we need to get rid of guns in a country full og psychopathic rhinos, corrupt government forces and evil spirits that melt with a 9mm to the face. So, if you nightly watch the daily show and aren't infuriated by the half stories you hear, you shouldn't really have a problem with it.

Then we get to your character, Ajay Ghale. He has no character. Similar to Jason Brody, he really has no character. Is this a bad thing? Looking at every other character in the game save for Pagan, no. This way, he's not ruined.

If you diddn't like crafting in FC3, i got bad news for ya. In FC4, there are animals that only appear in the 2nd half. And that's not even including the special animals. It's really annoying having to be low on ammo all the time for half the game, or not have enough explosives as you'd need  because clouded lepoards won't appear.

Enemy troops are a alot tougher. In FC3, i don't remember them gunbutting you flat onto your butt, which these ones will do anytime you get within 5 feet of them. Then you have a standing up animation that takes away your ability to fire for 1 second after standing up, in which case you will of lsot half your health. If you remember the heavy gunners, they're now all over. And 1/3rd through the game, their helmets are part of their outfit, so you can no longer knock it off for an easy headshot.

There's a new enemy type that charms animals, can't be tracked, can see you through foliage and shots arrows that hurt like sniper rifle bullets. Have fun with that!

Weapon wise, there's a few additions, like a webley and a mauser, Most weapons still have terrible addition restrictions nerfing them into neigh unusability(No supp. for SVD, Only 1 add-on for SG550, ect). There's patches avaliable on a quick google search, but still. The new weapons range from useful like the MG42, the auto-crossbow, the compound bow and the new grenade launcher, to useless like the Webley and the Mauser. Hit detections gets a bit iffy at times too. I can't even count how many times i've lined up a clean headshot only to have ot phase through.

Animals in the game are OP as crap. a honey badger can take 10 5.56mm rounds to the face before it goes down. Headshots aren't 1-hit kills unless they're large calibur, It's frustrating to say the least. They also added cliffracers in the form of eagles. Have fun with that!

There's alot more options in the game now for predator gameplay. You can now throw bait to make a predatory animal spawn such as a tiger or a honey badger, You can ride elephants, you can throw knives for a semi-long distance takedown, You can move bodies as to not tip off enemies, or make a bodypile. Grenades can be toggled to be sticky, as can C4 and Proxy mines(VERY useful!) The wingsuit is avaliable almost immediatly and us utilized oftenm and there's an auto-chute deploy feature! No more stupid  foot fall deaths!

All in all, this game is an improved version of FC3. The only thing FC3 had that this game doesn't was a much better no-syringe heal system, as in you could almost fully heal with one arm-wrap. This is a very good game

The concensus is that the story of Far Cry 3 was more compelling - I agree. I just don't feel the same for Ajay Ghale as a I did for that other guy. Also, the choices you make throughout the game feel like they have very little impact except for the moment in which you make them. 

Far Cry 4 is still a great game. There are still outposts to conquer, with new larger outposts called strongholds. They added a controversial ""buzz copter"" to the game, which is a mini-helicopter. Personally, I loved the addition and made plotting my attack on outposts more enjoyable. In fact, the entire game has an added verticality - it takes place in a mountainous environment which allows for rope climbing and longer wingsuit flight.

Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to try out the co-op, but taking down outposts with your friends sounds amazing. Also, with the addition of user-made maps there is a huge number of things to do outside of the regular game.

This game I got immersed in right of the bat , exploring every corner to hunt game to upgrade my gear , the missions are very diverse and I feel immersed in what ever I am doing at the time , the politics and tensions do play a nice role but it is kind of a bummer --spoiler alert-- but nothing you do seem to change the situation for anyone in the country regardless of who's ideals you follow, at the end you feel like the country would be better off if you simply stayed in the room where Pagin told you to stay. - I do hope this gets addressed in  future dlc's 

But the ride was fun and incredibly detailed even the side quest into shangri la was awesome!!!! 

For the bad - 
Taking towers is easy (with a buzzer you can practically do anything)

- Great voice acting
- Graphics are great on all settings (Low - Ultra)
- Idle dialogues for enemies are funny
- Cutscenes are fun to watch
- The hunting is great
- The weapons are very fun to play with and use
- Sounds for the animals, guns, vehicles etc.. are awesome
- Gyrocopters

Cons:
- 30FPS capped cutscenes
- AI has super vision (Can make it more immersive but can also be irritating)
- Cutscenes can sometimes have audio errors where no audio is played
- Sometimes your wingsuit won't have the prompt to use it and sometimes it will
- Story is quite a bit more abstract than FC3

14183270,76561198141192142,"One of the most ""finished"" ubisoft titles of 2014, Far Cry 4 continues the franchise in the himalayan mountains in the war-torn region known as Kyrat where Ajay Ghale returns to his parents home to spread his mothers ashes. Upon arriving he is stopped by the incredibly flamboyant Pagan Min and his army. Ajay soon has a heshen bad removed from his head to be in Pagan Pins fortress, kindly offered a serving of Crab Rangoon, but Ajay's guest isn't so lucky and is taken away. Shortly after you're asked to stay put, but being held by somebody who you're not sure if your anus is safe it might be the best time to be smuggled out by the locals.

Fun characters, impressive visuals, some very cool weapons once you finish the game, it seems like all positives in this exceptionally fun game. Sadly the game becomes repetetive and boring after about the 75% campaign completion mark. This was one of my gripes for Far Cry 3, but because the world was so well done with some much to do you don't ever notice it in Far Cry 4, until the home stretch is in sight. I will however mention the music in the final mission was fantastic.

It uses the same engine as Far Cry 3, you may not tell the difference until you play it. With this said it is very different and more refined than Far Cry 3, however I would be unforgiving if Ubisoft were to do the same with Far Cry 5. There's a 'Blood Dragon' spinoff in the works for Far Cry 4 which I'm looking forward to and some DLC which I plan on getting.

Far Cry 4 holds an interesting story in an interesting location, but there's much more pointlessness to the story because in any ending the story doesn't change and you can just kill everybody who drives the story after it's complete. I confess, I would have loved to be able to visit the mountains and prison again on demand, but it seems this will only happen via DLC and paying more money. So in a vast open world experience in a modified version of Far Cry 3's engine we reep the same results regardless of our choices and being limited to your location even once you finish the game. Open world only implies you can go where you want when you want, with risk of being killed by the locals or wildlife. Unfortunately Ubisoft have locked you to the confines of areas you've unlocked and anything past that you'll see ""you're leaving the mission zone"", ""this is a dangerous area, turn back"" ect and because of these small problems as well as altitude limitations the gameplay feels as though Ubisoft have cheaped out on the expansiveness of this game. You shouldn't be surprised though, every Ubisoft title comes with these problems.

Other problems include compatibility and optimization when using higher graphical settings and presets. Again there's another ongoing problem with Ubisoft and SLI, but let's not go there again. It's extremely demanding for what it is due to bad optimization, as if Ubisoft don't really care for us PC gamers, but again this is nothing new. Once you've found the best configuration for your machine, you'll be on your way. I do believe this game is a great benchmarking tool, I've recieved up to 70% GPU usage on both graphics cards once the driver was modified for SLI and identified a shortage of power delivery to be fixed this week.

Though this review seems oddly negative, it simply can't add much positivity to it's predecessor. It is insanely fun, and I forgive Ubisoft for simply re-releasing an old product with a new engine, new maps and story etc. I will not be forgiving if Far Cry 5 follows the same trend on a yearly release. It would be wise of them to slow down release times to get everything perfect.

14136243,76561198007428578,"Well to start ill say i loved Far Cry 3 so was really looking forward to this game. And while it is still a great game it did leave me feeling a bit dissappointed. In the game you play Ajay Ghale who at the beginning of the game is returning to his birthplace of Kyrat to scatter his mothers ashes and quickly finds himself caught up in a civil war between the Golden Path and the dictator of Kyrat, Pagan Min. 

As a location Kyrat isn't bad. It modelled on Nepal so you have a pretty mountainous area this time round as opposed to the tropical islands of FC3. The gameplay hasn't changed much either with stuff like hunting, outposts and towers making a return as well as the story missions. Some new additions include being able to ride elephants (which is fun), bow and arrow (which is admitedly useful esp for hunting) and a grappling hook (good idea considering the terrain in the game but feels a bit clumsy sometimes.) 

In terms of story though this is where the game falls flat on it's arse as it just isn't very interesting and feels like background noise. Most of the main characters are pretty dull. Even Pagan Min is a dissappointment but Vaas is a hard act to follow. Most of the story missions are pretty dull and irritating as well particularly the ones that require going to the Himalayas as they are pretty linear and a lot of missions try to force you to play a certain way instead of giving you the freedom to choose your own method. One interesting new feature with the Golden Path missions is the choice between two missions between the rival leaders of the Golden Path, Amita and Sabal which makes you decide who you want to side with.

Most of the fun in this game is to be had away from the story however. There's plenty of side missions a lot of which are more entertaing than the story ones and theres plenty there to keep you occupied as well.

The game does have multiplayer which i briefly tried and while it does try something a bit different with one team armed with bow and arrows and a cloak ability, and the other armed with guns it didn't interest me much. Theres also coop for the campaign which i didnt try.

The Good:
-has a lot of the fun stuff to do outside the story
-has a couple of decent new features
-great new environment

The Bad:
-dull story and characters
-story missions are too linear and not a lot of fun

Overall this is a great game that ultimately didn't impress me as muchas its predecessor but still manages to be enjoyable. Worth picking up particularly if you liked FC3.

14086229,76561198026712677,"When reading this please keep in mind that I love Far Cry 3 and spent probably around 150 hours in it. I've beaten the story 2 times, I conquered all outposts dozens of times and I've got the max level in MP. I reached the point now where I am totally done with FC3, and ready for FC4. I played FC4 now for around 30 hours, but I'm already done with it because I am so disappointed.

If a game series is moving on to a new chapter, then I personally expect some kind of progress in the basic gameplay while keeping the good moments and the atmosphere of a game-series. This is my main complaint about FC4: the lack of progress. The thing which made FC3 awesome was that the developers really tried to take the criticism of Far Cry 2 to heart and create a great new gaming experience. 

In FC4 I can't see anything of this. It's FC3 in a new setting, telling basically the same kind of story and fails to add some significant gamechanging features. The basic-gameplay (movement, gunplay, driving, flying, etc.) is a total rip of the predecessor, with all good and bad. Similar thing with the features: exploring, hunting, leveling, side missions, enemies - mostly the same stuff as before, most of the time worse then FC3 (Hunting is totally the same, only 2 skill trees left with a few more ""skills"", some new sidemissions, only one new type of enemey, ~70% ripped weapons, ...). 

The story isn't as good as FC3. The FC3-story itself wasn't extremely good, but basicly ok and lived by the great characters. FC4 also tries to create some interesting characters, but fails to compare to FC3 yet again. 

The technical side of the game is well-done. Kyrat is a beautiful setting, the graphics are as impressive as the sounds (nice music, great weapon sounds, good synchro). I haven't noticed any bugs so far. Only complaint here is the very ugly menu and some of the controls, which is caused by the console-port. One big plus is that you can play everything except the story-missions in coop. I can't say much about MP because i'm really not up for it anymore.

FC4 might be a good game standing by itself, but compared to the progress FC3 made after FC2 this is a total shame. If you are going to say that Battlefield 4 is Battlefield 3.5, then you also have to say that FC4 is FC3.2. After I finished FC3 I was really up for a new game experience, but this isn't it - only a new setting and some extremly disappointing features doesnt justify 60€ or the ""4"" behind ""FC"". Feels like an addon, so why sell it as full-price? Next time, Ubisoft, take one or two years more and then release a game which really brings the series to a new level.

14024824,76561198013056652,"well, this game, for me, is buggier than assassin's creed unity and watchdogs combined. I had trouble with the first runs, that made it unplayable... but those  were patched. Then, I had about an hour of bug free gameplay. When suddenly, my game just decided to start running in windowed mode... This was the start of the typical ubibullshit. Suddenly, out of the blue, I can no longer run it fullscreen period. Took me a while and a good bit of being pissed off to figure that out. Now, I get random crashes... All for different reasons. Sometimes it stops responding, sometimes it stops my drivers, sometimes it just closes. I really don't know how software just breaks like that but it did. 
Some people complain about lowfps, now the game actually seemed optimized fine, I was running 2k settings in it which I almost never do in games. The shadows suck though, and the overall look of the game is nothing special. Nothing you haven't seen before.
So besides the fact that its pretty much broken... heres a couple more reasons to avoid playing this.
When you do actually get the game going, you want to troubleshoot your settings a bit. First time, you're gunna get about 15 or more minutes of intros and cutscenes... that you can't skip. So even if you save your graphics settings there, and restart the game to feel its fully applied, guess what... its all fucking reset and you have to watch the unskippables again. In fact, every cutscene is unskippable, and trust me, you're gunna want to skip some of these, because they are just stupid. 
Here's another really irritating fucking thing. So, you actually play a little, it's telling you to go to the first mission but you say no, because it's an open world and you're still kinda troubleshooting. Well, you go left instead of forward, because thats the only other way you can go really. You find a hanglider. You get on it, and die asap. You're reborn, you get back to it thinking you screwed up, get on it, and die again. You do this 3 more times and realize, no, there is nothing you can do, this hanglider hits a tree during its take off animation and it will kill you every time you use it. So there goes the first hour of your far cry 4 experience. 
So here's some pros for the game.
You finally just say fuck that fucking hanglider, you go to the mission, grab an atv, and then go ram that hanglider the fuck off the cliff. You play some of the story and start to get the hang of the mechanics and crafting and weapons. Start to care for the story and your character development. Maybe play a coop with a way better player. Then BAM. (back to a con) your game breaks. Suddenly you cant go fullscreen, suddenly you can't go 10 minutes without freezing or crashing or drivers stopped working...

So what do you do, you go and play assassin's creed unity just fucking fine, while all your friends complain about how it doesnt work at all for them and they ask you to come play farcry.

Would play again the campain currently doing it but will do it slowly since i will frequently rage quit also i have season pass still waiting durguesh prison.\n"", ""timestamp_created"": 1421358778, ""timestamp_updated"": 1421358778, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 4, ""votes_funny"": 1, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.524994373321533203"", ""comment_count"": 2, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

( In a good way) Much more than Far Cry 3. The game is extremely well optimized. Runs as good as Far cry 3 if not better. Much more guns than FC3 as well, all unique. 

-The Co-op- 

The Co-op includes everything you would image a co-op to have. Separate side missions. Almost flawless compatibility and everything the singleplayer has except the singleplayer campaign. How the co-op works is, you go into the menu and press invite freinds. The uplay overlay will open, and you invite the friend you want. Extremely easy. Whoever is host will have the same progress as they did in the campaign. So the content he/she unlocked in the singleplayer will be transferred over to the co-op, which is a feature I like alot.

-Battles of Kyrat-

This game mode is a 5v5 versus match, with a variety of game modes. You can pick from different maps, and upgrade your charter with the ingame points you get for scoring or getting kills.

-Community Maps-

Commuity maps are the maps other people make with the Far Cry 4 editor. Some can be good, and some not so much. But I had fun with them never the less. Pretty strait forward.

-Map Editor-

The map editor is basically a simpler version of a full game engine. You can't make your own models, or textures (as far as I know) but it still isn't to restricted. You can still make some incredible maps. You have almost all the assets from the full game to use. You can change the water level, add npcs, change the skybox, and the ambient sounds, grass, trees etc.

13980733,76561198019356234,"Meh is about all I can say.

Sure, it's a decently fun game, you run around and shoot stuff like 100s of other FPS games; but that's about it.

First and foremost, it took 2 months and several patches before I could even play the game, so that was a huge let down and let me know out the gate that the game wasn't ready for launch, but of course they launched it anyway.

Co-op is still bugged to hell, invivisble vehicles and enemies anyone?

The story is pretty bland and leaves everything to be desired. 
The main ""bad guy"" is a white rip off of Vaas from Far Cry 3. 
The conbat feels like it came right out of the early 2000's, basic and uninspiring to say the least. I mean, in a game based soley around combat, you can't even pistol whip someone.
The driving controls are archaic and terrible.
The option to not be forced to join the ""golden path"" would have been nice, but it is what it is.
The entire map is quite small when compared to other franchise titles. The only thing that makes it seem like the world is large is the fact there are so many mountains that you have to contantly go around (when not fast travelling of course).

I could go on and on and on, but there's no point really. Ubisoft clearly rushed this game in order to cash in on xmas and end of year sales; and clearly doesn't give a rats *** about producing a quality title.

The only reason I still play it is because a buddy of mine and I play together on co-op and are trying to get the most out of our money by running around doing nonsense like running through invisible cars/people and racing on quads/dune buggys. So if you're looking for a game that you can utterly waste time in but have no real expectations of a premium game sold at a premium price, then this title might be right for you. Otherwise, spend your money on something else and have more fun than just ""wasting time"".

13979355,76561198052846286,"Ok so... honestly Far cry 4 was a really fun game, there are only three reasons I cannot bring myself to reccomend the game. 

One the storyline: yes it was interesting but it seems forced at times, and the choices you made wether it be to preserve or destroy have no effect what so ever (as far as I can tell) after you finish the main story except a few lines, even the major choices like kill (no spoilers), or spare (no spoilers) doesn't matter at all! 

Two (oh am I gonna get hate for this) the villains: yes Pagan is a great enemy who you can learn to love/hate but he, and his entire group get next to no explination. In fact the one villian I actually thought about after the fact was Paul and thats because I parked and listened to his whole story, the rest of them have very little told about them other than basic things told right before, during, or after their fight. Even Pagan himself gets little explination untill the very end other than, yeah he's a crazy dictator who knew your mom, can you kill him for us?
  
Three pointless side missions: You would think liberating the entire south would lower the amount of enemies right? well not by much (if at all). Also a person would be lead to believe there was something to force them to liberate outposts right? The answer is a big nope, I left the entire north and there was no penalty at all except unlocking a weapon I would never buy. The last bit I can add to the pointlessness is this, after you find a chopper you will never have to touch the ground or non-required enemies again.

While I may not like aspects of the game its still REALLY fun and some of the characters can really make your day (Yogi & Regi), and to be honest I liked the written story in the game and if they had incorperated what the written lore has then I would definitly reccomend this game. Also the satisfying ending is lovely (no spoilers, but bring the worst pistol if you want to laugh).

13949069,76561197996630468,"This remarkable game has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. The purpose of THIS review is to give me an opportunity to organize my own thoughts about it. I have played all Far Cry games on PC (Far Cry and Far Cry 2, multiple times. And don’t forget the awesome Far Cry: Blood Dragon). Far Cry 4 is very similar in concept to Far Cry 3 – both very large open world games in which the protagonist, (unskilled, inexperienced, unequipped) struggles against the brutal tyranny of a charming psychopath. Although I enjoyed Far Cry 3 from beginning to end, Far Cry 4 got off to a very rocky start for me. But first the good stuff.

The implementation of stealth is very well done in this game. I say this after just finishing Crysis 3 in which there was no stealth. In Crysis 3, if you weren’t cloaked while crouched and peeking around a corner, you would be instantly fired upon by soldiers or aliens a half mile away. Ridiculous! Not so in Far Cry 4. And you really need to be stealthy in Far Cry 4. The good news is that stealthy behavior pays off a lot. Don’t need no freaking nano suit.

Elephants. One of the most fun elements of the game, riding elephants. You have to pay for this as a skill. So, work up to it. Elephants are a very safe and practical way to move across the map. Encounter an enemy patrol, no problem. Run the elephant into them and melee with the elephant’s trunk. You can destroy oncoming enemy vehicles head on. Loads of fun. Elephants also provide great protection against the multitudes of predators that menace the landscape. And even while dismounted, nearby elephants act on your behalf with close encounters involving harassments by enemies.

Shangri-La missions. Although the main story is fine, I especially enjoyed the five missions to Shangri-La. I hadn’t read about the game beforehand and I was very surprised by these missions. I especially appreciated the expose’ and enactment of the battle to wrest control over Shangri-La from the forces of evil. I was joined by a svelte ally for most of the missions. Arena style battles here and very, very challenging. Yet beautiful and enchanting.

Ghale Homstead. Reminded me of the Hearthfire DLC in Skyrim. You need to find this location, and it takes some doing to get there. Once established, you can pay for upgrades. One of the best upgrades is the option to purchase a buzzer – little gyrocopter. Buzzers are awesome ways to travel and scout out unexplored territory, but they are hard to find as just random drops. But once you own one, just fast travel to the Ghale homestead and climb in.

DJ Rabi Ray Rana. I really enjoyed the mindless chatter coming out of the radios. I know some players hated this guy, but I loved him. He injected some interesting and positive energy in what was otherwise a dreary and hopeless existence. Most of all, I loved the music that accompanied his show. I am still looking for a playlist of his music.

Weapons. As always, there are amazing weapons choices, but (as always) you have to build up to them. My favorite sidearm was the Auto-Cross. This is an automatic mini-crossbow. It is a silent one-shot killer and it is indispensable in the times before acquiring a silenced sniper rifle. I loved this thing and I never stopped carrying it. Still carried my bow, but for long-distance silent kills, the Auto-Cross excelled.

Grappling hook. It was awesome. Easy to use (after some practice). Never glitched.

Lore. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional country nestled between India and the Himalayan Mountains. The game’s setting is filled with ancient lore and beautiful traditional art from the region – paintings, statues of hindu deities, and shrines. The value and importance of the region’s beliefs and heritage becomes a critical consideration later in the game. I chose to preserve it.

Ethnic origins. It was pretty obvious that the Adherents and soldiers of the Golden Path were of Indian (or thereabouts) descent and the Royal Army was of Chinese origin. Accents and even expressions in native tongues revealed this difference. Somewhat mirroring the ongoing struggle in Nepal between natives of Tibet and Chinese from the north.

Noore’s Arena. Meh. Hunger Games style battles with supporters tossing in resources for you. The public address commentary is sensational and perfectly captures the depraved sentiment of the event. But after a few rounds, the arena becomes a grind to unlock weapons. You make a little money but not much. In order to unlock the much coveted Bushman silenced assault rifle, you need to achieve level 10 in the arena. I chose not to. It would be hours of formulaic running, gunning and healing. Not for me.

Now, some of the problems I had with the game. Let’s start with the main quest. In a word, fragmented. On reflection after finishing the game, the main quest seemed uncohesive, not pulled together. It kinda just went… “wherever.” For example, it seemed that after completing a main quest challenge, then afterwards for a time, there was nothing. No more challenges, no place to go. I suppose this “down time” might have been intended to give me a chance to explore the vast map, but I just felt a little too much set adrift. Then suddenly a new main quest challenge would pop up on the map. I eventually got used to this and it was fine. But overall, the story and action did not naturally cohere. It’s like reading a book and finishing a chapter. Then turn the page and there’s nothing but a blank page and several more after that. Then after a few more blank pages, you discover the next chapter.

Here is an example. As you might expect, there was the obligatory betrayal and imprisonment episode. Not surprising. But after the escape (which was a big ordeal and a really hard challenge), there was nothing. No response or comment by the antagonist. No, “I’ll get you for escaping my prison!” One day I was in his prison. The next I was out. And life just went on as if it had never happened. Lame.

Flying and falling glitches. One of the iconic activities of Far Cry games are the hang gliders. But I was conditioned to stop using them in Far Cry 4. Often I would just die immediately after deployment. I mean instantly. No collision, just falling and death. Wingsuit too. Jump off a cliff and hit the control to deploy the wingsuit (Shift key in my case) and nothing. No wingsuit just falling and death. The only device that worked reliably was the parachute. They really screwed up this joyful mechanic in this game.

Dogs. In some regions, the landscape is “hounded” by packs and packs of wild dogs. To the extent that it becomes boorish. Each pack has four or five and each dog takes nearly a full clip from an assault rifle to kill. There is just no way to walk terrain in these areas. Always need a jeep or an elephant. Which sucked because I prefer to walk most of the time. Thankfully, most regions don’t have dogs but they were present in enough places to give me a sad. In the S.T.A.L.K.E.R, games there were dogs too, but one headshot would kill them, and THEY were mutated super dogs. So, the implementation of wild dogs in Far Cry 4 was dumb.

Overall and despite some minor complaints, Far Cry 4 matched and in some cases exceeded its predecessors. The landscape is the most beautiful I can remember playing on. The bot AI was masterful. The choices I have as a player are enormous. Stealth, grappling hook, Auto Cross, elephants, buzzer, Shangri-La and I almost forgot, Yogi and Reggie help make this game very worthwhile.

The purpose of THIS review is to give me an opportunity to organize my own thoughts about it. I have played all Far Cry games on PC (Far Cry and Far Cry 2, multiple times. And don’t forget the awesome Far Cry: Blood Dragon). Far Cry 4 is very similar in concept to Far Cry 3 – both very large open world games in which the protagonist, (unskilled, inexperienced, unequipped) struggles against the brutal tyranny of a charming psychopath. Although I enjoyed Far Cry 3 from beginning to end, Far Cry 4 got off to a very rocky start for me. But first the good stuff.\n\nThe implementation of stealth is very well done in this game. I say this after just finishing Crysis 3 in which there was no stealth. In Crysis 3, if you weren’t cloaked while crouched and peeking around a corner, you would be instantly fired upon by soldiers or aliens a half mile away. Ridiculous! Not so in Far Cry 4. And you really need to be stealthy in Far Cry 4. The good news is that stealthy behavior pays off a lot. Don’t need no freaking nano suit.\n\nElephants. One of the most fun elements of the game, riding elephants. You have to pay for this as a skill. So, work up to it. Elephants are a very safe and practical way to move across the map. Encounter an enemy patrol, no problem. Run the elephant into them and melee with the elephant’s trunk. You can destroy oncoming enemy vehicles head on. Loads of fun. Elephants also provide great protection against the multitudes of predators that menace the landscape. And even while dismounted, nearby elephants act on your behalf with close encounters involving harassments by enemies.\n\nShangri-La missions. Although the main story is fine, I especially enjoyed the five missions to Shangri-La. I hadn’t read about the game beforehand and I was very surprised by these missions. I especially appreciated the expose’ and enactment of the battle to wrest control over Shangri-La from the forces of evil. I was joined by a svelte ally for most of the missions. Arena style battles here and very, very challenging. Yet beautiful and enchanting.\n\nGhale Homstead. Reminded me of the Hearthfire DLC in Skyrim. You need to find this location, and it takes some doing to get there. Once established, you can pay for upgrades. One of the best upgrades is the option to purchase a buzzer – little gyrocopter. Buzzers are awesome ways to travel and scout out unexplored territory, but they are hard to find as just random drops. But once you own one, just fast travel to the Ghale homestead and climb in.\n\nDJ Rabi Ray Rana. I really enjoyed the mindless chatter coming out of the radios. I know some players hated this guy, but I loved him. He injected some interesting and positive energy in what was otherwise a dreary and hopeless existence. Most of all, I loved the music that accompanied his show. I am still looking for a playlist of his music.\n\nWeapons. As always, there are amazing weapons choices, but (as always) you have to build up to them. My favorite sidearm was the Auto-Cross. This is an automatic mini-crossbow. It is a silent one-shot killer and it is indispensable in the times before acquiring a silenced sniper rifle. I loved this thing and I never stopped carrying it. Still carried my bow, but for long-distance silent kills, the Auto-Cross excelled.\n\nGrappling hook. It was awesome. Easy to use (after some practice). Never glitched.\n\nLore. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional country nestled between India and the Himalayan Mountains. The game’s setting is filled with ancient lore and beautiful traditional art from the region – paintings, statues of hindu deities, and shrines. The value and importance of the region’s beliefs and heritage becomes a critical consideration later in the game. I chose to preserve it.\n\nEthnic origins. It was pretty obvious that the Adherents and soldiers of the Golden Path were of Indian (or thereabouts) descent and the Royal Army was of Chinese origin.

13947515,76561197983910619,"Describe Far Cry 4 in one word? - ""Random"".

It is not just that Animals keep spawning from out of nowhere behind you in the area the you have just swiped completely clear - No Ubisoft put randomness to a whole new level. Here are a few examples of what kind of randomness you may experience:

- Wildlife 
   Animals which were not there before keep attacking you from behind once you concentrate on the next area.
   Eagles keep dropping on you in the middle of a fight, killing you instantly.
   This also has been the Case in the previous parts, but the amount increased drastically.

- Wingsuit 
   You sprint down a hill - the wingsuit opens and you can crash and die at the next tree.
   You jump down a cliff and fall to death because it won't open.

- Enemy detection 
   One time they see you throu a wall, the other time you face them standing up and the don't detect you.

- Enemy reaction 
   Once they have detected you it is completely random wether they shoot at you instantly or try to stare you to death.

- Sidequests
  This is by far my favourite: There are random side quests (ie. in the form of Trucks driving around.)
   Sometimes an enemy convoi pops up behind you killing you instantly. 
   Sometimes if you have spotted it before on the map you wait forever, trying to ambush it, because it already despawned.


Okay enough about the randomness, the Game also has a few Pro's:

- Beautiful graphics (as seen in FC3)
- Nice story so far (but not as nice as in FC3)
- Interesting characters (as seen in FC3)
- Detailed open world (as seen in FC3)
- The ""Tibetian highlands"" surroundings are pretty unique
- A shitload of Weapons, Modifications, Loot Craftables, yadda, yadda... (even more as in FC3)

But I still think the Con's are a lot worse:

- The complete randomness of control, events and behavior of the game
- Multiplayer coop ? (What the hell Ubi? This is NOT AT ALL what you promised - see below)
- No ability to skip past cutscenes you have already seen 
- Autodrive (If you build auto drive into a game you might as well have it check the path for collisions)
- Random game crashes
- Uplay in general
- Have I mentioned the game's randomness?


Also a few more words on the Multiplayer mode: 

When the game was announced it was totally hyped that you will be able to ""walk around the open world in coop"". Well so far they managed to do that. Once another player yoins you will see eachother and you can also explore the world together, hunt animals for skins or tka on side missions. That's it. In the moment another Player joins all missions vanish from the map. So you can pick from about 6-7 activities. No quests. No true coop missions. And the best  part? If you are not close enough to eachother the connection will drop. Also the sidequests will only be saved for the player who opened the game. IMHO the Coop in FC3 was a lot better.

***UPDATED REVIEW***

Finally came back around to this and it was patched to playable status, ONLY IF all the NVIDIA stuff was turned off.  I think I managed to get away with using the nvidia hbao+ and it didn't crash, but every other feature caused display driver crashes to desktop.  

i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz with a water block and a GTX 980, SSD drives all around.  

The game itself - 

It's the same formula as Far Cry 3, so you know what you're getting if you're a fan of the series.  It has excellent mission and mechanical polish, and I did thoroughly enjoy the story line as it played out through completion.  There is a LOT of fluff, as is standard for your Ubisoft open world formula, but they gave everyone enough variety to taste.  If you want a 100 hour experience, it's here in the form of the 100%.  If you want a 30 hour experience it is also here, and it feels just right.  If you want to slam through the main mission structure you'll probably run through it in 15 hours.  

I did enjoy my time with it in the end, but it is still endlessly frustrating that flagship video hardware and AAA title integration is this dysfunctional in 2015, but in context this is a trifiling matter.  There's a delicious buffet to choose from in this game, and that shouldn't be totally disregarded simply because one or two of the things I was hoping to enjoy weren't on order.

many people have complained about this game. Many people have said that it is too much like Far Cry 3, that there isn't anything new. As they went on, they mentioned bugs, glitches, and a multiplayer mode which is not working. but that's a FAR CRY (badumm tss) from the truth. Not that far though. 

What they failed to mention is that, while 4 is very much like 3, it also is more than that, and, most importantly, more fun. AC 2 was a hard copy of 1 with a little cherry on top...ok,  a big cherry, but the following games all used the same principle. Now, after they puked out a hundred titles of tower climbing simulator, people finally noticed and started to complain.  
Yes, FC3 and 4 are similiar. You cant expect an open world shooter to be a chess game with hookers, can you? But it's still wildly entertaining, on a very base and simple level, which is not a bad thing, as you can see with other base and simple things I can't write here. 
Now, there were some things I didn't like. 
Maybe it is a lot to ask, but who am I playing? Some guy, coming to Kyrat to scatter my mothers ashes. And of course I am also perfectly trained in combat, able to comandeer every vehicle, use every weapon perfectly...seriously, he comes out of nowhere and dishes out some stuff that would make most war vets wet their bed. At least that surfer guy in 3 had his magic tattoos which gave him spiritual...killing...and...aiming...powers....I guess.  Just a little hint as to why I am suddenly a one man army, would have been nice, narration is after all an important part of a game. 
The fortresses, while a great idea, were meant as a co-op opportunity, very hard, and, as the voice over states, almost impregnable as long as the residing antagonist is still in charge. This was a blatant lie, since I could snipe my way to the heart of the fortress with ease, and  I am a casual gamer. I imagine the hardcore guys  did it while reading Ulysses or something. Overall, easy outposts was that easy. You might argue that the game gives you the opportunity to make it harder for youself, with a differnet set of weapons, or doing it while only using takedowns. While this might be fun for some, I don't want to cripple myself to artificially (haha, while talking about a game) to increase the difficulty. so...that could have been done better. 
I liked the Idea of the Hunter enemy, tougher to fight, able to control the wildlife (how? you ask? it's a game ubisoft says, buy it and shut up) and...rarely seen. possibly out hunting or something. I remember 4 distinct skirmishes with them, other than that, absent. then again, they might be busy, who am I to argue with their day to day work. 
It is a shame that almost all the weapons are taken from FC3, also, there are several weapon sets which, in combination, are so ridiculously overpowered that you can basically play as asian rambo/chuck norris most of the time. The Z93 for example, a sniper with, if you wish, a silencer, is able to kill a guard from 4 meters away (45.432 hobscotches for our friends in the colonies) and his friend right next to him can not hear it. And I did not play on easy or anything. 
Also, driving still feels like you comandeer a bar of soap on soapy streets in a hailstorm of soaps while eating soap. 
Now, what did I like. 
The main antagonist is, like in Far Cry, devillishly charming. Evil, ruthless, cruel and also very eloquent. I was always waiting for him to broadcast something, or call me, or show up, which could have happened more. I also liked the connection to asian rambo, in other words, you, the player, obviously, who himself appears a tad bland next to such an demonic peacock. The other characters are more or less well executed, I also liked de Pleur, though I can't say why because of spoilers. Willis appears again, also nicely done, and overall, a story unfolds which I was interested in. Not overly interested, but still. 
I enjoyed traversing the area, collecting the wildlife to do my bidding as an ammuniton receptacle, there were other side quests which enticed me to follow because of the story they told, spoilers, again, so, see for yourself. 
Actively including animals in the fights through the use of bait was a nice touch. sometimes it didn't work though, because 'no animal is interested in your bait'. then again, ubisoft might have been going for realism here. Oh, and riding elephants into battle...yes. that please, again, on rhinos maybe. Lots of killing happend. Good times. 
before I forget. I hate eagles now. bastards, the lot. 
in summary, even though it might sound as if I actually didn't like it, I did. very much. 
The good thing is, even though I only have a 550 TI, the graphics were still pleasant to look at. I would compare it with FC3 on Xbox. I was at this game the whole week now because there is so much to do, so much to see, so many foes to smite with the use of my mighty soundless wonder sniper. 
I would have wished for some more new additions, maybe some different takedowns, or some more opportunity to invole the world around me in the action, like they did in the promo video with the barrel and the c4. I also hope they don't bring down they series with worthless DLCs, though it's ubisoft, so they will, as far as I can tell. 
I bought it for 45 Euros, and I don't feel like I have been ripped of. If you enjoyed FC3, you will enjoy FC4, they do give you a lot to play with. I would not pay more though.

*edit*
I corrected some typos, sorry for those. Also I like to add that some of the maps created by users are more fun than crying really far.

13900095,76561198055466265,"Oh where do I start with this game. This game is my favorite game of 2014, just like how Far Cry 3 was my favorite game of 2012. Im a huge fan of the Far Cry series, and this game delivers so much.

So in Far Cry 4 you play as Ajay Ghale. Now, lets actually start off with one of Far Cry 4s first problems. Ajay Ghale is probably the most paper thin character ever, you know nothing about him, he never really seems to show any personality, he's just another character in the game, some of the NPCs you talk to in order to get side missions seem to have more personality than him.

Anyway, on to the story, which actually isn't bad, despite Ajay hardly ever saying a word. You play as Ajay Ghale returning to his birthplace Kyrat to spread his mothers ashes at a very specific location, titled Lakshmana. In the beginning, you are on a bus that sneaks people into Kyrat, the bus gets pulled over by some soldiers, and then the bus gets shot at. You get out through the back of the bus, where some guys start pointing their guns at you, and then a helicopter lands, and a man steps out. This guy is Pagan Min, who is the leader of Kyrat. He acts very friendly to you, tells you ""He recognizes those eyes anywhere"" and then after he talks to you a little he puts a bag over your head, and then the scene ends.

Pagan sits you down at a dinner table with one of the other guys on the bus who lived, talks about your mother, who he knew and was friends with, then stabs your friend after seeing he is texting the Golden Path for help. He is taken off to an interogation room and you are promted to leave. Once leaving you pass by his interogation room where he is being electrocuted and in the next room you see a man named Sabal saying he wants to help you and is with the Golden Path. You leave, get shot at a bit, shoot at some people, and the next 20 minutes of the game is finding your way to Sabal after you are sepparated.

Eventually Sabal takes you to a village where you meet Amita and some other characters, and then you do 2 missions which are just A LITTLE to similar to Far Cry 3s first missions. Take over a bell tower, hunt some animals (though this time it gives you an actual hunting weapon. 

After this it is revealed that Pagan is a dictator who is against what Kyrat used to be, he doesn't want their traditions, their religion, anything, and that what the Golden Path is against, so the rest of the game is you running around being either Amita or Sabals little slave essentially. Ajay just does what either of them says with no questions asked. Though this might sound like a bad story, some of the characters are just fantastic, Noores backstory is sad, her family was kidnapped and she is forced to lead the Arena, where they throw people into to force them to fight each other and fight against animals, Paul de Pleur (I think thats how his name is spelled) is honestly just a sick and twisted person who you want to stab, Pagan is an intelligent and funny leader, all the characters are really good, except Ajay.

Now the gameplay, its more or less Far Cry 3, the guns fire very similarly, there are a good portion of reused weapons (although there are PLENTY of new ones) and thats all there is to say about the guns, they dont have a lot of recoil, and they are pretty easy to learn to use. The exploration is where its at though, this has one of the best open worlds in a while, its giant, its very open, there is plenty to explore, there is not anything I can find wrong with it. The driving, again, more or less Far Cry 3, but this time it has a feature that was definatly designed with controllers in mind, auto-drive. Self explanitory, this is due to the new drive and shoot feature which is hard to use with a controller.

Graphically this is a absolutely wonderful game. With Nvidia Godrays on, or enhanced godrays as they are called now, and all the other settings on ultra, this game smacks the crap out of the consoles graphics, it looks so nice, just go look up some screenshots.

When it comes to the port, its decent, not as bad as AC:Unity, but its not really fantastic. Runs at 30-45 FPS maxed out (minus AA) on my 4690k paired with an R9 270 2GB with 8 GB ram. This was after editing the gamerprofile.xml and turning off mipmaps. While some people say this makes it looks like shit, I see no difference. I also set GPUMaxedbufferedframes to 1.

The co-op lets your friend drop into your game, and you can shoot some dudes in the head together, there is no story, only side missions, I have spent a good portion of my time with this part of the game.

This game is my favorite game of 2014, just like how Far Cry 3 was my favorite game of 2012. Im a huge fan of the Far Cry series, and this game delivers so much.\n\nSo in Far Cry 4 you play as Ajay Ghale. Now, lets actually start off with one of Far Cry 4s first problems. Ajay Ghale is probably the most paper thin character ever, you know nothing about him, he never really seems to show any personality, he's just another character in the game, some of the NPCs you talk to in order to get side missions seem to have more personality than him.\n\nAnyway, on to the story, which actually isn't bad, despite Ajay hardly ever saying a word. You play as Ajay Ghale returning to his birthplace Kyrat to spread his mothers ashes at a very specific location, titled Lakshmana. In the beginning, you are on a bus that sneaks people into Kyrat, the bus gets pulled over by some soldiers, and then the bus gets shot at. You get out through the back of the bus, where some guys start pointing their guns at you, and then a helicopter lands, and a man steps out. This guy is Pagan Min, who is the leader of Kyrat. He acts very friendly to you, tells you \""He recognizes those eyes anywhere\"" and then after he talks to you a little he puts a bag over your head, and then the scene ends.\n\nPagan sits you down at a dinner table with one of the other guys on the bus who lived, talks about your mother, who he knew and was friends with, then stabs your friend after seeing he is texting the Golden Path for help. He is taken off to an interogation room and you are promted to leave. Once leaving you pass by his interogation room where he is being electrocuted and in the next room you see a man named Sabal saying he wants to help you and is with the Golden Path. You leave, get shot at a bit, shoot at some people, and the next 20 minutes of the game is finding your way to Sabal after you are sepparated.\n\nEventually Sabal takes you to a village where you meet Amita and some other characters, and then you do 2 missions which are just A LITTLE to similar to Far Cry 3s first missions. Take over a bell tower, hunt some animals (though this time it gives you an actual hunting weapon. \n\nAfter this it is revealed that Pagan is a dictator who is against what Kyrat used to be, he doesn't want their traditions, their religion, anything, and that what the Golden Path is against, so the rest of the game is you running around being either Amita or Sabals little slave essentially. Ajay just does what either of them says with no questions asked. Though this might sound like a bad story, some of the characters are just fantastic, Noores backstory is sad, her family was kidnapped and she is forced to lead the Arena, where they throw people into to force them to fight each other and fight against animals, Paul de Pleur (I think thats how his name is spelled) is honestly just a sick and twisted person who you want to stab, Pagan is an intelligent and funny leader, all the characters are really good, except Ajay.\n\nNow the gameplay, its more or less Far Cry 3, the guns fire very similarly, there are a good portion of reused weapons (although there are PLENTY of new ones) and thats all there is to say about the guns, they dont have a lot of recoil, and they are pretty easy to learn to use. The exploration is where its at though, this has one of the best open worlds in a while, its giant, its very open, there is plenty to explore, there is not anything I can find wrong with it. The driving, again, more or less Far Cry 3, but this time it has a feature that was definatly designed with controllers in mind, auto-drive. Self explanitory, this is due to the new drive and shoot feature which is hard to use with a controller.\n\nGraphically this is a absolutely wonderful game. With Nvidia Godrays on, or enhanced godrays as they are called now, and all the other settings on ultra, this game smacks the crap out of the consoles graphics, it looks so nice, just go look up some screenshots.\n\nWhen it comes to the port, its decent, not as bad as AC:Unity, but its not really fantastic. Runs at 30-45 FPS maxed out (minus AA) on my 4690k paired with an R9 270 2GB with 8 GB ram. This was after editing the gamerprofile.xml and turning off mipmaps. While some people say this makes it looks like shit, I see no difference. I also set GPUMaxedbufferedframes to 1.\n\nThe co-op lets your friend drop into your game, and you can shoot some dudes in the head together, there is no story, only side missions, I have spent a good portion of my time with this part of the game.\n\nSo overall, 8.5/10, great game, but things like shooting were a little to similar to Far Cry 3, and the character you play as is just terrible. No personality at all. Also, I have plenty more than 23 hours in the game, closer to 45 hours and have beaten the game twice, I torrented the game at first, but I loved it so much that I had to buy it.

Singleplayer is fun, plain and simple. The game does encourage a stealthy game style, sneaking around, taking down baddies with takedowns, bows, and silenced pistols (as any other silenced gun makes too much noise, incidentally), but after you get some actual good weapons, a run-n-gun assault approach works just as well. The latter half though is when the bigger guys show up, wearing armor of their own most of the time, and with guns that shred your health in seconds. Oh, they also roll and move a lot to keep them from being an easy target. You're bow suddenly isn't a one-hit kill against most, stealth becomes more of a necessity, and you'd best have a ton of explosives on you if you don't have the heavy takedown skill, as their gun will send you scrambling for cover more so than the others. Assault still is possible, but you're going to want to have a co-op partner with you, or call in some ai-controlled backup to divide the fire a bit, because it does get hellish. And those syringes that you probably didn't need? Yeah, get them, stock up, and make it a habit of using them regularly. 

Still, the difficulty curve keeps it from getting too boring or repetitive. It's fun, the story is good, if a bit simplistic, saved by the good characters in it, though. Oh, and the main bad guy actually doesn't die half-way through the game. (Lesson learned, apparently) 

Multiplayer's a bit different. I don't know if it's generally ubisoft's servers or if not a lot of people are playing it at one time, but connecting absolutely sucks. A shame, because the multiplayer is kinda fun once you get into it, assuming you get into it at all. And stealthily taking aim with a bow while your tiger pet hunts with you is just as exciting as always on the watch for the smallest shimmer out of place, and meeting it with a hail of bullets. 
But again, connecting is an issue, the levels sometimes don't load, forcing you to quit, you get booted out sometimes if you can't connect right, and it generally turned me off of continuing it. 
Also, i wish they kept far cry 3's system of the top player of the winning team deciding what happens to the top player of the losing team. It was always fun to either choose to be merciful to them, or humiliate them further. That needs to be reinstated.

Far Cry 4 is an open world, freeroaming first person shooter. Many of the mechanics from Far Cry 3 remain, such as hunting and crafting to increase how much you can carry (ammo, items, money, etc), taking over radio towers for revealing the map, taking over outposts for quick travels points, and various side missions unlocked when you take these things over. Signature weapons remain as suped-up versions of guns you can get within the game after completing certain events in the world (take over so many outposts, towers, complete so many side missions, etc). Another big similarity to FC3 is that you start with only half the world open to explore and unlock the other half by progressing through the campaign. They did improve upon these features slightly, but didn't change too much of the formula. One new addition was fortresses. They are similar to outposts, but more difficult to take over.

As far as the story goes, you return to spread your mother's ashes and get caught up in a war between a group of rebels called the Golden Path and Pagan Min, the games antagonist. Pagan Min is not nearly as good of an anatagonist as Vaas was, but they did a good job of creating a new anatgonist and didn't try to make a copy of Vaas. There are some missions where you choose which leader of the Golden Path you want to side with, which does change up the mission a bit and adds some replayability to the game. They also did a good job of keeping a balance between how powerful the weapons you have are and how tough the enemies are, but signature weapons are still insanely overpowered, which can be tons of fun. A disappointment I had was with the snowy areas up in the mountains. Those areas were all mission-based locations and were not part of the open world for you to explore.

If you have played FC3 , then FC4 is very similar, and very long.. I am currently in the 30% of the campaign.
Pros.
- Highly detailed graphics
- lots of places to explore & side quests.
- Choose to play att your own time, and take the campaign one at a time.

Cons:
- Too many side quests, eg. when i was sneaking up on a outpost to do a recce before the attack, a out of nowhere eagle swop down & attack me... so i used my shotgun &... naturally it gave my position away.. along the way, you will get atttack by leopards, rhinos, dogs, snakes and many other animals... IMy personal hatred is for the honey Badger... LOL.
- After completing a mission relating to the campaign, the NPG AIs will not tell what to do or go next... most of the time I wandered around.. looking for side quests
- The interface for the gameplya, especially the syringes... could have been better managed, like in FC3. It took me a while before I mastered it on PC.

Conclusion; 

Can buy if you have lots of time to play....

13859439,76561198111144432,"Overall, I'd give the game 4 out of 5 stars. It's a beautiful game with some really fun features and missions. If you enjoyed Farcry 3, then Farcry 4 will be enjoyable too. It does at times seem just like Farcry 3, almost a carbon copy, which is a turnoff for some. However, I loved Farcry 3 so much, that it did not bother me. However, the thing that bothered me the most is how buggy the game gets by the second half. There are so many bugs, that it becomes game-breaking by the time you unlock the rest of the country. 

1. I get attacked by animals more often than it is natural; this is Kyrat, not Australia. I get attacked by wolves every two minutes and they always strike right when I am about to take a shot, and there's always at least five of them, two of them usually get me stuck in a quick time event which is just annoying after the 1000th time. The animation for eagle attacks starts way too soon, so I usually don't have time to wait for them to be in range to a shotgun blast. 

2. The enemies are unbelievably hard by the end. They can hit me with perfect accuracy 100 meters away and can somehow take 5 sniper shots to the torso. Heavy units in FC3 always had a small weak spot to sniper attacks, but there doesn't seem to be anything like that later in this game. Hellicopters seem to be able to shoot at any angle without missing a beat.

3. Climbing QTE on mountains works only half the time in the northern region, making it near impossible to find all the collectibles. I'm a completionist, so this one may not seem like much, but it's the principle of it all.

This is not the first time I have had terrible bugs near the end of a Ubisoft game (Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed 3). It is like Ubisoft is only worried about the first impression the game makes, but it's the last impression that stays with me after I'm done.

13853722,76561197996914247,"Fantastic game.

The open world looks amazing with well done animals and characters (eagles are annoying tho).

The map is great and is quite different to other games as it is based on the biggest mountains in the world.

There is so much to do which you can do at your own pace even if you complete the main campaign there are still many other side missions and collectables.

This game also has the choices affect the outcome of the game which is always something that has appealed to me and makes it replayable to see the different outcomes.

The character interactions are hilarious some of the things said in the game had me in tears.

Something I love about this game is the need to unlock areas by doing certain tasks like taking out bell towers then the outposts and finally the fortress I really liked this aspect of the game.

The weapons are amazing and there are quite a few to unlock while playing.

I would recommend playing single player then co-op if you can find some friends who like to play as well.

I never encounted any bugs while playing the only issue I had the entire time would be when trying co-op there are times when you both get disconnected for no reason.

I am disappointed that there were no Steam achievements although there are Uplay achievements.

You will need to have Uplay installed and an account.

I would recommend this game to anyone, I am going to be playing it again to try out other choices in the game.

I have had no experience with Far Cry 1,2 and 3 so I can't base this review off them.

I would recommend getting during sales and not at full price.",1420490289,1420490289,1,0.49543407559394836,2152,2043,1422589603,"{""recommendationid"": ""13853722"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197996914247"", ""num_games_owned"": 468, ""num_reviews"": 96, ""playtime_forever"": 2152, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 2043, ""last_played"": 1422589603}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Fantastic game.\n\nThe open world looks amazing with well done animals and characters (eagles are annoying tho).\n\nThe map is great and is quite different to other games as it is based on the biggest mountains in the world.\n\nThere is so much to do which you can do at your own pace even if you complete the main campaign there are still many other side missions and collectables.\n\nThis game also has the choices affect the outcome of the game which is always something that has appealed to me and makes it replayable to see the different outcomes.\n\nThe character interactions are hilarious some of the things said in the game had me in tears.\n\nSomething I love about this game is the need to unlock areas by doing certain tasks like taking out bell towers then the outposts and finally the fortress I really liked this aspect of the game.\n\nThe weapons are amazing and there are quite a few to unlock while playing.\n\nI would recommend playing single player then co-op if you can find some friends who like to play as well.\n\nI never encounted any bugs while playing the only issue I had the entire time would be when trying co-op there are times when you both get disconnected for no reason.\n\nI am disappointed that there were no Steam achievements although there are Uplay achievements.\n\nYou will need to have Uplay installed and an account.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, I am going to be playing it again to try out other choices in the game.\n\nI have had no experience with Far Cry 1,2 and 3 so I can't base this review off them.\n\nI would recommend getting during sales and not at full price."", ""timestamp_created"": 1420490289, ""timestamp_updated"": 1420490289, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 0, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.495434075593948364"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

They aren't completely worthless either, they are events that are actually fun to complete and reward you sufficiently as to not waste your time.

So, my thoughts on this one? It's a very pretty game. Faux-Nepal is appropriately exotic for the setting. All the gameplay mechanics from Far Cry 3 have been smoothed including the UI. The main antagonist(Pagan Min) is easily the most interesting person in the game, and happily is around until the end - I liked having not one but multiple times to either execute him or spare him, but of course I shot down his helo without an eye blink cause he's a ridiculous mass murdering psycho, but I appreciated having the option not to. Same with Sabal and Amita, although to be fair there should have been an achievement for tracking them down after the end credits and then killing whichever one you sided with in-game, because frankly they both needed to die to, and here again I appreciate the trouble Ubi Montreal went to to set up a final cutscene for each of them after the end credits where you could see either of them at their worst and then gun them down. I just think it should have been an achievement.

Also, the mountainous terrain felt authentic, which means that walking anywhere meant having to CLIMB, and climb, and climb, and climb, and climb, and climb, .....and basically I wouldn't have bothered with half the side quests in the game without the addition of the helicopter to the available vehicles. Also the radio towers weren't supposed to be annoying in this game, but they that's a big fat lie.  Luckily, you can use the helo to fly to the top of most of them.  The helo plus the thumper also a great time.

In Far Cry 3 the bow and arrow was my favorite weapon. In this game it was made redundant very quickly by the inclusion of the signature weapons silenced M14clone(better range, better firepower, just as quiet). Alternatively, the signature weapon version of the MG42(nicknamed Buzzaw) was just the most fun I've had with an FPS in ages. It was just so satisfying mowing anything down, flunkies, heavies, rhinos - basically it turns the most annoying baddies into gnats to swat.  Fans of the anime film Jin Roh should get a kick.  

Fuun stuff to do:  Shoot down a helicopter with a mortar.  Wingsuit into fortresses and procede to take down everyone without being detected(total badassery).  Do all the nanimal control quests with the Buzzaw, and madman giggle the whole time:)

Some ideas for DLC - 1) eagle shoot , ie set up an anti-aircraft gun in the game where the player can shoot down eagles with a flak cannon. Also a mini-game where the quest is to eradicate them from the map wouldn't hurt either.

2) Do the same for wolves, rhinos, tigers, dholes, leopards and any other animal that started chewing on my leg while I was trying to set up a quiet headshot during a mission objective.

So 4 out of 5 ultimately. The game is more polished than it's predecessor, even though I have to be honest the story isn't quite on the level of Far Cry 3.  Just not as engaging.

P.S. No seriously, I want an achievement for gunningdown Sabal or Amita after the end credits roll.

I think the good part of Far Cry 4 is that Its gameplay is fun, liberating radio towers and taking out outposts is very fun. Fighting mechanics arent bad, and blowing things up is the best. To me, the most fun thing about this game just doing shit. The upgrade system is pretty fair, and skydiving with a wingsuit is awesome.


                                                                                          The Bad
The bad, sadly, is a lot of things. One of them is the limited map space. Yes, I said it. Until you complete a certain mission (a trip to the north or something) you cant access that area. This is very annoying because I cant finish: 1. liberating bell towers, 2. Destroying outposts, and 3. Taking out the remaining fortresses. Not to mention that the storyline is completely ridiculous. You, Ajay Ghale come to Kyrat to spread your mothers ashes. Seems simple enough. No, you have to take your time to jump up from the table that pagan gave you the crab rangoon and join the golden path... Ok, so what is so bad about this... It ruins your reputation as a person! If you just waited for pagan to come back, you can spread your mothers ashes and screw the storyline to its fullest.

                                                                                             The Ugly
Ok so what is the ugly you ask? Well this. Countless bugs, hardcoded mouse acceleration, constant stuttering, it seems completely endless. First of all, I faced a glitch where the press e to heal button never left until I left the car I was in. That was annoying. Ive suffered healing animation bugs where when your health bar hits a certain point as you are getting shot, it quickly switches animations. Gives you an idea of what you suffer. I would consider Far Cry 4 to currently be in a medium alpha stage. Also, people think this is just a console port. I cant really disagree with them because when you aim and let go of the button, it takes a couple milliseconds for your gun to be brought down.

                                                                                                The End
In the true and ended finish of this review, I will not quite be able to give this a sunny side up. It is too glitchy, and unfinished. The story just didnt cut it. I could only tell you to buy this to do absolutely the opposite of what you are supposed to, and blow everything up. Become a rebel perhaps. I dunno. 6.5/10

This game has experienced several game breaking bugs. The most popular one being a black screen at start-up. There is at the moment no patch even though 1.4 was supposed to fix the problem. Besides that problem there is also framerate stuttering on high perfomance rigs, crashes upon death of character, horrible mouse sensitivity and poorly configurable mouse acceleration, little to no controller support (including razer mice and keyboards: those create the black screen crash at start-up), just straight up will not run on dual core processors, etc.

Apart from this, you have to download the game from steam, but then launch it from UPlay (Ubisoft's version of Steam. Yes you have to make an account). That is horribly annoying and resource heavy.

13819016,76561198009585358,"Far cry 4 is the latest installment of the Far cry series, as of writing. In what turned out to be a disasterous year for Ubisoft, Far Cry 4 turned out to become a decent product. Fortunately, I did not experience any of the launch issues, so I had a smooth play throughout the game. That said, the game featured tons of graphics options to customize your experience. I cranked it out to 60 fps and ultra setting and it looked absolutely stunning. Truly one of the most beautiful games of the year. 

The story and gamplay leave much to be desired though. The gameplay is just a rehashed version of FC3. The hunting challenges felt too easy. Most of the exploration was rendered pointless when they hand you a gyrocopter 20 minutes into the game. However, it is still satisfying to slaughter your way through hordes of animals and baddies.

The storyline is extremely linear with an interesting plot twist, but the games plot and side-plots are riddled with incoherent storytelling, and lazy conclusions. Nearly all of the secondary plots in the game have no form of closure, or receive some very cheap copout closure. 

The multiplayer provides an interesting twist on the traditional 4v4 pvp, but its limited game mode leaves much to be desired. Once you've played one match, you've played them all.

Overall, I would give this game a 6.5/10. 

It provided fun for a good while,  but it lacked immersion and coherence to make me love it, like I liked Far Cry 4. Is it worth $60? Not really, I would say purchase this game on sale, or find some way to get it free (I purchased it with money made from CS). 

In the end, while Far Cry 4 will lack the memorability of its predecessor, it is still some decent fun with some of the best GFX of 2014.

This game is amazing. I love the atmosphere and culture of Kyrat. I actually did some digging into Tibetan/Napallese history and culture beforehand, and as far as I can see the game is very accurate. 

The core gameplay is very smooth and I was immersed in the game dispite some techincal issues (see below). You start out with a basic set of skills, you can shoot, you can stab, you can drive, you can fly, you can swim. There is a very cut and dry stealth system as well that isn't very extensive but it does the job.
 There is a very unique crafting system in which you hunt for specific animals, skin them, and then craft item upgrades. Might I add that there is an extreme variety of wildlife, or at least it feels that way for me. So much so that they can start to annoy you. For example, you're trying to sneak up onto a group of enemies, when all of the sudden a freaking Eagle decides to swoop down and bite you! AN EAGLE!

Now for the graphics and performance!

Graphics: Pretty damn good. The hard textures like the water and rocks have much to be desired, but the grass and trees look amazing. Far Cry 4 has this ""Fur"" machanic that is supposed to make the fur look authentic, it looks pretty but sometimes the fur just doesn't look right. You'll see what I mean when you play the game. The lighting also is very pretty. I would recommend that you would keep the lighting on at least ""High"" because it contributes so much to the scenary. 

Performance: It's not an Assassin's Creed Unity, but it still does suffer. A big issue, is when you fly or drive around the game the FPS drops suddenly to 30 and then back up to 70, at least for me. I'm running a GTX 970 on Ultra and even Medium I get dips to the 30's. Ubisoft has been releasing patches so we'll just have to see.

13805560,76561198082380488,"I have only played far cry 4 for a short time from what i have played i have a good understanding of the game.

Preformance and Graphics:
overall when playing i got an average of 35 fps and a maximum of 50fps (in game) with playing on high setting (i had to customise slightly but most setting were on high)below are my specs:

i5 processor
8 gb RAM
gtx 750 (1 gb)
2 tb hardrive 

and overall it ran smooth like jelly however i would't recomened playing on any setting lower than high as it looks rough and i have not experienced playing on ultra setting but playing in high setting looks good.

Open world experience:
the world is massive not as big as other games but very big and there is enought to do to keep you busy as there is lots of activitys and karma events (events that pop up randomly) many animals to kil and hunt BUT as many other people have explained it is very much like far cry 3 which can be both good and bad depending on weather or not you enjoyed far cry 3 (personaly i enjoyed far cry 3 so in my opinion this is a good game) however there are not a massive number of improvements and new additions added compared to far cry 3.  

The price:
this is a very expensive game (in my opinion) even if bought in the sale and at the moment i have completed 35% so i am guessing that this will take me about 30 - 40 hours to complete on the other hand if you like far cry games and open world games this is a good investment. 

The story (NO SPOILERS):
even though i have completed 35% of the game i have on played a few of the story missions but in total there are only 30 or so story missions in the game and 3 of which you need to complete to free roam. from what i can tell the guy that you play as is like a zombie as has no thought or personallity as you want to spread your mothers ashes over a place but then randomly decide to join the freedom fighters for no reason and just do stuff with no personallity or motives however pagen min make the story good with out him this game's story would be painfull to play.

Uplay:
every time a new game comes out on steam that is made by ubisoft and needs uplay i always see people complaining about uplay however i'm not sure if its because i already have uplay and a uplay account i didn't have any problems with uplay so far.

Online and co-op:
at the moment i have not played online co-op or pvp so i do not know if it is of any good.

Conclusion:
If you enjoyed far cry 3 you will like this if you have never played a far cry game before but like killing stuff and explosions you will like this if you want to run some one over and then drive off a cliff to then wing suit into a tree you will like this and finally if you want to see an eagle pick up a pig and fly away into the distranc ewith a whole pig you will like this.

9/10 would watch a eagle steal a pig again.

>Best bad guy the series has seen so far
>Improves on every aspect of Far Cry 3
>Quads are no longer terrifyingly unstable
>You get the wingsuit early on

>Non-repetitive gameplay
>Multiple (5, I think) endings
>Improved map editor
>Easy to install, and play custom maps
>Fantastic voice acting
>There's a few more that I can't think of at the moment

NEUTRAL:
>Much more difficult than Far Cry 3

CONS:
>Not exceedingly well optimized (runs worse than Crysis 3 on my PC, but definitely shouldn't given the graphics)
>Though the villan is a good one, we don't see much of him
>There's a handful of bugs here, and there; none are game-breaking, but can be annoying, and mess with the cutscenes (for example, in the first Sabal mission in the north I accidentally killed the Pagan imposter in a way that cancelled the following cutscene, leaving me confused)

Generally its like FC3, just better with more features, plenty of mini sidequests and rich missions.

Outposts can be conquered over and over again, so you can try different approaches and compete online by increasing your ""takeover""-score and make it on to the online leaderboards.
As a sniper/stealth fan myself, I really dig this feature. :-)

There's a ton of locations to explore and plenty of enemies to deal with when travelling between locations.

Graphics looks really great and the performance seems very steady, I don't really experience ups and downs in my fps which varies about +/- 3 fps.

I run the game off an AMD Quad 3.4Ghz, 16GB DDRIII, a GTX970 gfx board in 3 screen Eyefinity (5760*1080) setup and with almost every gfx settings on ultra (max) and that gets me a steady 35 fps (which in gaming-geek terms isn't enough, but is adequate to the avg Joe).

Running the game with every setting on max, like 8x AA etc. I reduce the fps to 1-3, BUT the gfx aren't that more impressive on those settings, but being able to run the game with some sort of AA is important imo, Ive tried running with no AA and that truly made the game look really horrible and with tons of flickering edges everywhere.

So bottom line on the performance imo, is that the game is well optimized, considering that itll run smooth and look really good on a mid-range gfx card like the GTX970.

There has been reported some crashes due to a memory leak which has been addressed, but the game still chews thru ur mem steadily while its running, even if u r not playing.

13777644,76561197965532102,"If you like Farcry 3, you'll love Farcry 4.
i recently completed my second play through of FC 3 when 4 was announced. few months later i had it.
Yes i may have had to upgrade my pc to run it, but it was a long time coming for that + it was very worth it to have it run on ultra.
The gameplay stays very similar to FC3 throughout, but there is small additions here and there that really smooth it out, as well as adding to the game.
Without spoiling, just to give some examples. Auto crafting healing syringes. Better map layout/design. Better AI for animals/NPCs. Just all round better.
Coming straight from FC 3 to FC4 i was not dissapointed, and cetainly not bored. But that might just be that i am a big fan of the sandbox fps's.
there are some texture issues/ small bugs that Ubisoft have been trying to fix since the games release, but honestly they are small issues that barely effect the game as a whole. (and this is coming from someone that hates 3rd party software, Uplay, GFWL, Origin etc)
The only thing i think was not up to scratch compared to FC3 was the story. FC3 had (in my opinion)
a very gripping story line that reminded me alot of the novel Heart of Darkness, the personality of your character changes dramitcally from the start of the game to the end, immersing you into the jungle as a frightened teenager, to come out the otherside as a full blown jungle warrior.
FC4 storyline is not bad by all means, but i just felt it lacked that immersive feel.

Overall i would rate it an 8.5 out of 10 with FC 3 being a solid 8.
Dont get me wrong 0.5 doesnt sound like a big increase, but when you're basically talking about the same game with different features and made better, at least its going in the right direction unlike most sequels.
iv always been a big fan of the FC franchise (excluding 2, that was very hit and miss) and would highly recommend  Far Cry 4",1420180535,1426491428,1,0.5561762452125549,4799,4691,1422244480,"{""recommendationid"": ""13777644"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197965532102"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 20, ""playtime_forever"": 4799, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 4691, ""last_played"": 1422244480}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""If you like Farcry 3, you'll love Farcry 4.\ni recently completed my second play through of FC 3 when 4 was announced. few months later i had it.\nYes i may have had to upgrade my pc to run it, but it was a long time coming for that + it was very worth it to have it run on ultra.\nThe gameplay stays very similar to FC3 throughout, but there is small additions here and there that really smooth it out, as well as adding to the game.\nWithout spoiling, just to give some examples.

13759886,76561198015645326,"I won't try to write some hugely comprehensive review nor will I write in a fashion where I try to convince you to play it or not -- I'm just a gamer, assumably just like you...I'm not paid for writing reviews and though I don't mean this in a vein of sounding bitter, but I don't really care if you play the game or not.

First things first --- my simple ""flow chart"" of decision for this game -> Have you ever played Far Cry 3? If no -> Do you like open ended game play? Do you like games with ""missions"" and character skill trees/progression?  Required: Do you like first person shooters? If you like at least one of the ""optional"" questions and you answer yes to the required try this game...but look for it on a sale.  (Note: If you don't like shooters....um....stop reading this and just move on. Its a first person shooter).

If you played FC3 and you liked it -> No brainer...it would make virtually no logical sense if you enjoyed FC3 but don't like FC4. Conversely if you played FC3 and hated it -- you'll probably hate FC4.


Moving on.....as you might have figured out I enjoyed FC3 and I really like open ended games. I don't like heavy scripting in my game worlds...I want to feel like I'm in control of what I do. FC4 delivers on that.

The game looks beautiful, FC3 looked really good as well...I actually think FC4 looks a bit better. Granted I'm running my resolution / graphic settings on high/ultra (forget what the game calls the highest settings)....the water, the mountains, the grass, the trees, etc. all look photorealistic. Even the animals look realistic. The grass, flowers, leaves in the trees, all move in sync with the wind for added realism.

The point to the ""pretty"" and detailed graphics ----> immersion factor.

Good variety of weapons ....actually a lot more weapons than other shooter games I've played.

Tons of things to do in the game BESIDES just banging out the main campaign story. I have over 30 hours in the game but I'm not even 20% complete on the campaign. How is this possible? Well -- side quests and exploring my friends....there's tons of side quests in this game, in my opinion -- they are all fun. Granted, like any game, over time it gets repetitive but to a degree I think no game can answer that because its human nature and not the fault of a game to say ""really THAT mission again?"".... The best a game can do is offer enough variety that the amount of repetitive content is kept  to a minimum. I think FC4 does a decent job of that. 

My favorite things in the game?

I like playing stealth and trying to use  minimum resources (including ammo) to accomplish my objective. To me that makes the game much more fun to actually care about not getting killed or seen. To this end I really have fun liberating bell towers and outposts. Then there are fortresses -- think of outposts on steriods. The game even suggests you do NOT try to take them on solo (you can play co-op  or call in npc ""guns for hire"") ...well I tried to take one on solo...yeah i got owned. Man it was fun though...and that's what i like about this game so much, even where I get owned (make no mistake I have died a lot in the game already testing my tactics and limits of what i can do solo) I'm *usually* having fun. 

So what don't I like or wish was different?

Well despite I like how ""alive"" the game world feels with wildlife roaming free...it does get aggravating when you are stealthily approaching an outpost - ready to take that shot to disable the alarms and out of nowhere a friggin bear or tiger jumps you. Now the aggravation to me isn't that this happens at all -- its I feel it happens far too much and it makes no sense when you scan the entire area before you do your mission and you see nothing.....so what does a tiger just teleport on the high cliff edge to my back? 

The other thing is the game has some annoying ""balance of reality issues"" as I call it.....some animals are unrealistically tough....and some guns are too weak. Great example of each -- honey badgers....I've shot them with literally six arrows or many bullets before they die...that's just stupid. Yet I've dropped a huge yak with two shots from the same gun. Granted head shots matter but still it feels weird to me. There's an M700 sniper rifle in the game....in real life this weapon is well respected from both military and SWAT teams at least all over the USA....in this game I feel its too weak...I'm sorry but two shots center mass and the bad guy doesn't die? Really...its a friggin M700 rifle.

But as I'm getting good at head shots...and head shots are (rightfully) one shot , one kill....the annoyance with the m700 is very slight.

One last thing that's cool about this game -- while the AI isn't brillant, its pretty good...sound matters in this game. So if you shoot an elephant gun (btw the sounds of this game are pretty awesome...but I have a good sound card and 5.1 surround on my system too)  within just 100 or 200 yards of baddies ...they will react ""What the hell was that?!"" and they will look for the source of the sound. At the same time if you use a silenced gun (or better your bow -- the bow is friggin awesome in this game btw) they won't react the same.

There's a LOT to love in this game...I know I'm going to replay the crap out of it and pour tons of hours into it. There's cool moves you can do to -- like equip a wing suit and swoop in on baddies like you are super man and then go right into a weapon take down--which looks pretty bad ass and its fun . :)  You can ride an elephant and plow over vehicles mean while you can have a side arm ready to blow people away AS your elephant is running them over. :)

Anyway....I wrote a LOT more than I intended to....can you tell I like this game a lot? :)

13723466,76561198024163947,"Far Cry 4 is the latest in the series of open-world first-person shooters by Ubisoft.  To many, including myself, Far Cry 3 was one hell of an enjoyable gaming experience.  With Far Cry 4, Ubisoft decided to build upon Far Cry 3's open-world mechanics and add some new features for flavor.  In essence, Far Cry 4 feels a lot like Far Cry 3, but more polished.  For example, now random events happen more frequently, giving the player much more to do in between campaign quests.  There are more weapons and more vehicles to ride.  Outposts can be replayed infinitely for higher points and bragging rights on the global leaderboards.  Graphics have also been improved significantly.  Overall I would say Far Cry 4 improves upon most of the core aspects of Far Cry 3, but as many have mentioned Far Cry 4 doesn't break new ground.  Even so, playing Far Cry 4 is still a hugely gratifying and immersive gaming experience that will definitely keep you entertained for a long time.  

As for performance, apparently this game has had its share of performance issues/bugs at launch.  I waited a month for the patches to come through, and the current version of the game is very stable on my computer.  Running a first-gen Intel i7 and an AMD R9 290, I can run this game at 1440p at ultra settings with a decent average fps (about 50-60).  Obviously my setup is not top of the line, but even so I can almost run the game at max settings.  The only setting I cannot max out is the anti-aliasing, but I don't really care since 8x or 16x MSAA is overkill anyways.  If you are experiencing fps lag, I recommend lowering the anti-aliasing.  I'm not too sure why people are still complaining about performance, since I believe the game, in its current state, is optimized to run on PC fairly well (as was Far Cry 3).  37 hours into the game, I have yet to encounter a single bug or crash!

To conclude, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, you definitely owe it to yourself to get this game.  If you have ever played and enjoyed any open-world action game such as Assassin's Creed, the Batman: Arkham series, or Grand Theft Auto, I highly recommend giving this game a try as well.

So let's get right to it. This game is astounding. The storyline is excellent, starting off with Pagan Min, working with the Golden Path, finally reaching the point in either killing him or allowing him to live. (P.S. If you let him live, he takes your helicopter.) So, Let's go on the line with some of the things that disappointed me and astounded me.

Storyline:
+Good Villian
+Really Hard Decisions
+Regretting Said Decisions
+Continues to Add Up
-Often Gets Repetitve
-Kind Of Short

Combat:
+Good,Balanced Weapons
+Difficult Enemies
+Healing Syringes Can Be Taken From Fallen Enemies
-By Difficult Enemies, Once Every So Often. Makes The Game Easy
-Gun Shots Can Be Heard From A 500m Radius
-Pretty Easy Sometimes
-You Can Literally Hide And Hold ""C"". Again, Makes The Game Easy.
-Hard To Stealth

Wildlife:
+Rather Difficult To Take Down
+Animals Are More Difficult Than Enemies
+Rhinos Can Flip Vehicles
+Honey Badgers Don't Give A Shit

OVERALL: Far Cry 4 is a excellent game for it's time, with some downfalls in the combat system. The wildlife is typically balanced, except for the extremely unfair legendary honey badger. It's fun, and has some fast paced gameplay. The Co-Op is extremely fun, although it is kind of broken. UPlay can be a struggle to maintain with, but luckily, I never had a problem with it, surprisingly enough. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a great singleplayer game with a rather fun Co-Op mode for friends. I wouldn't say it's worth $60 though. Try purchasing this when it's on sale.

13675042,76561197994872722,"A great game and a hell of a good time: Far Cry 4 carried over all the best parts of Far Cry 3, improved what needed improving, cutting out the crap all the while setting itself up as a standalone title.
Before I go into too much detail, I'm going to write a quick disclaimer: I liked Far Cry 3 for the most part, but there were a few parts that single-handedly killed a massive chunk of the experience. For more information, my Far Cry 3 review can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220240

Now to the topic at hand, Far Cry 4:
To start off, FC4 takes place in a wonderfully rendered world. Set in the fictional country of Kyrat, the player takes in splendid visuals with bright and exotic color schemes offsetting the tall grey and white mountains of the mighty Himalayas, creating a very bright contrast resulting in some incredible and memorable environments. A perfect setting for an open-world guerrilla warfare game. As opposed to Far Cry 3, the setting has more steep, harsh vertical inclines that would ordinarily make movement restricted and difficult, but thankfully the developers took care and implemented fun and creative ways for you to explore this amazing world. Grappling hooks allow you to climb up cliffs and swing from ledge to ledge, a new vehicle in the buzzer (a miniature helicopter) lets you fly over peaks and valleys alike and of course, the return of the wingsuit. Climbing up to the highest mountain and not being able to soar off of it like an eagle would be a wasted opportunity, so the devs allowed the wingsuit to be purchased any time the player wants. You get it for free halfway through the game, but who in their right mind would want to wait until then? I really enjoyed the mountain environments over the tropical islands of Far Cry 3, being a Canadian built for the cold, I'd personally feel more at home in a couple layers of coats driving through a valley than sweating my hairy chest off in some bug-infested ""paradise"". Not a huge or even legitimate point in FC4's favor, but an example of how a players different preferences can add a lot to a gaming experience. 
The gameplay of FC4 is eerily similar to FC3, but thankfully that isn't too much of an issue since FC3 had a very well-built first person combat system, and carrying it over with a few tweaks makes a lot of sense and allows more budget to things that count. It's extremely open-ended and varied, you can approach the same situation in dozens of different ways, whether it'd be tactically minded and stealthy or guns blazing leaving a trail of swiss-cheesed corpses in the dirt. This time however, the stealth is much more challenging as the AI is more sophisticated. Enemies search an area thoroughly if they hear a sound coming from it and (annoyingly, I might add) sometimes spam the area in question with the new mortar cannon.
To give more depth into why I feel Far Cry 4 is a direct upgrade to Far Cry 3: I'll start with the most important (in my opinion) part, the story. The story has improved tenfold and is more engaging than the previous game. The plot centers around Ajay Ghale, a tourist visiting from America to spread the ashes of his deceased mother in her homeland as per her last wishes. What Ajay doesn't know, however, is that he has ties to Kyrat and it's politics, and as soon as he sets foot in the country those ties ensare him and refuse to let go. A way better setup than ""a bunch of annoying rich white kids get kidnapped on an island"". The villian this time around is the self-declared king of Kyrat, Pagan Min. He's the one who forces Ajay into the chaos of civil war while being a self-admiring psychopathic jerk the whole time, delivering some entertaining dialogue throughout the game. Pagan Min himself is a pretty colorful character, but he doesn't come remotely close to Vaas from Far Cry 3. Where Vaas was purely insane, unpredictable and likeable in a ""I hate you"" kind of way, Pagan feels more restricted and falls short when it comes to being as memorable as Vaas. 
The Outposts make a return in Far Cry 4, and by god they are improved in so many ways. Firstly, outposts and territory isn't as ""black and white"" as they were in FC3. You can still encounter enemies in friendly territory although at a lesser magnitude. Enemy forces will also occasionally mount assaults to reclaim outposts you captured in retaliation convoys or full out ambushes, while this does add a lot of flavor to the game it can often get just as annoying after a while. You leave an outpost as you head out to do whatever it is you want, and as soon as you leave you get a radio message ordering you to come back and defend. This happens painfully frequently and feels like you're not allowed to leave to do what you want until the game says you can go. 
Enemy distribution is more varied, with new types of foes that really work to keep you on your toes, especially the hunters. They can see you when you're hiding in a bush, they don't give off detection meters so you have no idea when they can see you, they can control animals (what?) and only communicate by whistles. Making them deadly, hard to spot and devastating to the unaware player.
Side missions are also improved, there are missions you can undertake for various characters who are each fun and inventive, and are genuinely enjoyable to interact with. Unfortunately, some of these side missions include the ""drug trip"" sequences similar to the ones in FC3. While there is legitimate reasons and believable explanations as to why you are hallucinating, these sequences still suck and aren't very fun to play through. Maybe if you're a stoner you'd enjoy it, but not me. Additionally, the terrible, out-of-place, contrived, incongruious and experience-ruining drug-trip boss battles are gone. That's right, GONE. No more working your way to a villain that you just want to shoot only to have control taken away from you for no reason and reducing the encounter to a series of quick-time events, because it's ""interperetive"". This time, when you fight one of the four main villains of the game the encounter is entirely realistic, and if there is a hallucination sequence at least there's an explanation for it instead of happening out of nowhere like in Far Cry 3. 
Out of all the side objectives, my favorite portion is the Shangri-La missions, which tells a story that is unique and interesting while also not being horribly distracting from the main game. 
Now to make some notes for the parts I didn't like: Far Cry 4 has horrible optimization that results in painful performance issues, regardless of your settings. AI is still laughably bad, where people driving cars are completely blind and plow through anything that's on the road. As well as the occasional visual, physics or animation bugs, but they really aren't as prominent as you'd might suspect.

To conclude this review: Far Cry 4 is an incredible game, countless improvements in every field that create an experience that is more than worth checking out. This is the game I wanted in Far Cry 3.

For more information, my Far Cry 3 review can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220240\n\nNow to the topic at hand, Far Cry 4:\nTo start off, FC4 takes place in a wonderfully rendered world. Set in the fictional country of Kyrat, the player takes in splendid visuals with bright and exotic color schemes offsetting the tall grey and white mountains of the mighty Himalayas, creating a very bright contrast resulting in some incredible and memorable environments. A perfect setting for an open-world guerrilla warfare game. As opposed to Far Cry 3, the setting has more steep, harsh vertical inclines that would ordinarily make movement restricted and difficult, but thankfully the developers took care and implemented fun and creative ways for you to explore this amazing world. Grappling hooks allow you to climb up cliffs and swing from ledge to ledge, a new vehicle in the buzzer (a miniature helicopter) lets you fly over peaks and valleys alike and of course, the return of the wingsuit. Climbing up to the highest mountain and not being able to soar off of it like an eagle would be a wasted opportunity, so the devs allowed the wingsuit to be purchased any time the player wants. You get it for free halfway through the game, but who in their right mind would want to wait until then? I really enjoyed the mountain environments over the tropical islands of Far Cry 3, being a Canadian built for the cold, I'd personally feel more at home in a couple layers of coats driving through a valley than sweating my hairy chest off in some bug-infested \""paradise\"". Not a huge or even legitimate point in FC4's favor, but an example of how a players different preferences can add a lot to a gaming experience. \nThe gameplay of FC4 is eerily similar to FC3, but thankfully that isn't too much of an issue since FC3 had a very well-built first person combat system, and carrying it over with a few tweaks makes a lot of sense and allows more budget to things that count.

Playing FarCry is bittersweet for me.  I enjoy the enviroment and storyline but I can't ignore the setbacks.  I will give an example of such in my review. Others might have other examples but these are mine.

First, I feel like I am not as emersed in the world.  The map is no longer a handheld map it's just another screen reminding me I'm playing a video game.  Also, I have to see the heal option even if I want to ignore it  (I know that I'm hurt).  This is even when my interface is entirely turned off.  I feel like I'm playing a ""dumbed"" down version of FarCry. Guns no longer jam.  I can not honk horns or choose when to turn lights (vehicle/flash) everything is auto.  When Radio calls come in you do no even switch to your com device.  No matter how much of the interface I turn off I still get interaction icons that will not go away.

On a positive note, I am excited about the map editor and continue to be delighted that this has not gone away from the series. 

Co-op is awesome!! (with the right friend)

Driving and shoot! pew pew pew...

I feel like the PC version was an afterthought even though the series has been supported primarily by PC gamers (Map Makers etc..) until the release of FC3.  My example is that my screen was black for this game until I unplugged all USB/Bluetooth Joysticks including my Microsoft Xbox 360 controller ?? After that the game worked fine using my trusty K-Board/Mouse.

The Characters are just as exciting, which is great.  If the villians sadistic murder in the opening scene isn't enough for you, give it time.

I love FarCry's ""Final Fantasy"" approach to the series.  Even though it's a similar game, the storyline and characters change. I feel like this keeps the game that I love fresh.

The vehicle damage seems less realistic.  Maybe it's just placebo effect, but it just doesn't seem natural the way it evolves.

I'm glad they kept a lot of my favorite weapons and added some new goodies to the arsenal. 

DLC keeps the game exciting, but I'm worried that this game is heading down the path of many DLC traps.  Make good games and gamers will support you. Trick us and we will DDoS you and Pirate you and stop supporting you overall. (anyways)

I would say this game gives me mixed feelings and I await some serious support patches. I would only recommend buying the game if it's on sale.

13672718,76561198030046451,"After playing several hours threw this game I must say it is a pleasure to play. It is a beautiful game and from the very beginning is feels like Far Cary 3. There are a lot of good things about this game but I have found a few things I didnt like.

Pros-
1. Visuals-
     The game looks beautiful and the world is HUGE. The detail that went into this game is outstanding and maxing out the setting makes everything look amazing.

2. Content-
     There is so much gameplay that you might never get bored. From following the story to a disappointing ending to hunting and gathering to craft bags and increase ammo and money capacity.

3. Map Editor-
     I love the fact that a map editor is included in the game and it gives you a sandbox for 4 types of mission. I prefer making outpost missions and testing how hard you can make it to go undetected, or make it like shooting fish in a barrel.


Cons-
1. The story-
         The story started out very well and I rather enjoyed getting thrown into this rebel uprising. You are then given choices on who you deside to follow within the Golden Pass, but when I finished the main story it feels like no choices I made even matter. Who I killed and who I decided not to kill made no difference in the end plot and they are also not even brought up again. It took about 10 hours for me to complete the main story, but I took another 10 just exploring, hunting, crafting, taking outposts and unlocking weapons, not to mention the hours you can spend in the gladiators arena.

2. Glitches and Bugs-
      With worlds this big there is always bound to be a few bugs, some I ran into in my hours of gameplay came from being detected by nothing to clearing a outpost or fortress only to find that it wouldnt complete it. I then had to leave or die and do it again which after 10 mins of scouting and planning would get annoying. Other glitches I found were with Hunter class enemies and animals not changing back to wild after there death which wasn't to big of a deal. The last glitch was just in AI moving glitches when the would rrandomly shoot across an area to another location while walking. Sometimes it was funny because they glitched off the mountain to there own death.

13658634,76561198038214352,"Far Cry 4 is essentially Far Cry 3- except with the compelling characters and story removed. It seems that in Ubisoft's rush to push out another Far Cry game, they've forgotten what made Far Cry 3 successful- not only was it fun, but it had a great story and the world you were messing around in was full of interesting characters. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3's mechanics, and aren't troubled by some gameplay stagnation, annoying characters and a hilariously awful plot, Far Cry 4 is a pretty good game. 

Now, I could take a long time to go over everything wrong with the plot and the characters and the presentation, but let's keep it (semi) quick. Your character has no decision making process, he does things simply because other characters tell him to. He seems to be embroiled in the conflict simply because he is superhuman. When I say superhuman I mean that besides the poorly explained ""skill tree"", the protagonist goes through no development. He shows up with practically the same stealth, weaponry and hunting abilities that he'll leave with. The skill tree adds takedowns, healthbars and syringe crafting (which never has any relevance to the plot- it's simply there and stays unexplained, unlike in Far Cry 3). 

The other characters are stereotypes that vary from boring to wacko and get little development or have any depth. In the main Golden Path missions, you choose between two ideologies whose only affect on the game is the objectives of the other missions you'll play. It's frustrating to play the main missions though, because despite the characters which represent the two ideologies constantly asking you to decide, you'll never be able to relieve any conflict or find common ground- after completing the mission the other character will yell at you and things don't seem to get any better.

Unfortunatley this seems to be the only conflict in the game, aside from the enemy soldiers who shoot at you. The main antagonist vanishes after the opening cutscene, unlike in Far Cry 3 where you constantly interacted with him. His motives for being a stereotypical evil villian are unclear, he's simply ""the flamboyant evil ruler"". Some of his henchmen are more interesting, but they suffer similar fates of being seen in one or two missions, while you're told how evil they are in other contexts.

Now, after three paragraphs of bashing the characters and presentation, I'm still going to reccommend the game. Mainly because there's nothing more satisfying than jumping off of a mountain, using your wingsuit to glide down a valley and just barely landing on a hill overlooking an enemy compound, only to use the next 15 minutes silently infiltrating, disabling the alarms, and finally methodically and silently killing all the soldiers there. It's awesome to be walking down a road towards some random thing on the map, only for an enemy vehicle to come screaming down the road with all intent to wreck you, but instead shooting an explosive arrow at it and watching it soar overhead in flames. Nothing is more fun than watching your pet tiger maul an ""evil demon"" while listening to someone recite ancient Indian epics in Hindi.

If you enjoyed Far Cry 3's mechanics, and aren't troubled by some gameplay stagnation, annoying characters and a hilariously awful plot, Far Cry 4 is a pretty good game. \n\nNow, I could take a long time to go over everything wrong with the plot and the characters and the presentation, but let's keep it (semi) quick. Your character has no decision making process, he does things simply because other characters tell him to. He seems to be embroiled in the conflict simply because he is superhuman. When I say superhuman I mean that besides the poorly explained \""skill tree\"", the protagonist goes through no development. He shows up with practically the same stealth, weaponry and hunting abilities that he'll leave with. The skill tree adds takedowns, healthbars and syringe crafting (which never has any relevance to the plot- it's simply there and stays unexplained, unlike in Far Cry 3). \n\nThe other characters are stereotypes that vary from boring to wacko and get little development or have any depth. In the main Golden Path missions, you choose between two ideologies whose only affect on the game is the objectives of the other missions you'll play. It's frustrating to play the main missions though, because despite the characters which represent the two ideologies constantly asking you to decide, you'll never be able to relieve any conflict or find common ground- after completing the mission the other character will yell at you and things don't seem to get any better.\n\nUnfortunatley this seems to be the only conflict in the game, aside from the enemy soldiers who shoot at you. The main antagonist vanishes after the opening cutscene, unlike in Far Cry 3 where you constantly interacted with him. His motives for being a stereotypical evil villian are unclear, he's simply \""the flamboyant evil ruler\"". Some of his henchmen are more interesting, but they suffer similar fates of being seen in one or two missions, while you're told how evil they are in other contexts.\n\nNow, after three paragraphs of bashing the characters and presentation, I'm still going to reccommend the game. Mainly because there's nothing more satisfying than jumping off of a mountain, using your wingsuit to glide down a valley and just barely landing on a hill overlooking an enemy compound, only to use the next 15 minutes silently infiltrating, disabling the alarms, and finally methodically and silently killing all the soldiers there. It's awesome to be walking down a road towards some random thing on the map, only for an enemy vehicle to come screaming down the road with all intent to wreck you, but instead shooting an explosive arrow at it and watching it soar overhead in flames. Nothing is more fun than watching your pet tiger maul an \""evil demon\"" while listening to someone recite ancient Indian epics in Hindi. \n\nFar Cry 4 can be a pretty fun sandbox, but I'm pretty sure this sandbox has some rabbit turds in it."", ""timestamp_created"": 1419755953, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419755953, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 1, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.499040305614471436"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

13651118,76561197982973766,"Steam needs a ""meh"" recommendation option.  I neither loved nor hated Far Cry 4 but at $50-60 I don't recommend this game.  Far Cry 4 feels very much like a really nice expansion pack for Far Cry 3.  A new setting, new characters, but ultimately the same core mechanics.  That's not a knock, I loved Far Cry 3, but I expect more from a full-price AAA title.  Even Assassin's Creed manages to iterate slightly on its gameplay.  Don't let my hours on record fool you, much of that time is from leaving the game running over night.

This time around I just could not get in to the story.  Where FC3 had a great 'Lost' vibe, FC4 lacks a suffciently compelling story to drive the action forward.  The opening sequence is such a frenetic mess of disjointed scenes that by the time I was in control of the protagonist I had no idea why he cared enough to stick around in Kyrat.  Nothing in the next 10+ hours convinced me that my character had sufficient motivation to do the things he was doing.  Nor were the side characters fleshed out well enough for me to understand or care about their stories.  Pagan Min's lieutenants are introduced briefly and killed just as quickly.  They could have been fodder #2935 for all I knew except they had unique clothes and hair.  

Gameplay is identical to FC3.  That's great and all but I wanted some more interesting challenges.  Like FC3 once you unlock a few of the more advanced weapons the game is a cake walk.  The fortress capture events provide the game's only real challenge and even these are only as difficult as you make them.  Sniping is so effective at clearing fortresses and outposts you'll start to wonder why the game bothers with assault rifles or pistols.  If the AI discovers a body or sees a comrade go down to sniper fire they'll usually run in your direction but if you are sniping from an unreachable vantage point then forget about them doing anything intelligent.  Seriously, how do you stride over the growing heaps of dead friends and not think to pull the alarm?  

Biggest negative:  As of this writing the mouse controls are dicey at best.  You cannot fully disengage the mouse acceleration and smoothing options implemented for console gamers.  There are tutorials for monkeying about with the configuration files but aiming always feels just a little *off*.  These issues are amplified by graphical lag, I opted to play on lower graphics settings and for the most part I could forget about the aiming.",1419726165,1419726165,0,0.5,1946,1946,1419718329,"{""recommendationid"": ""13651118"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197982973766"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 6, ""playtime_forever"": 1946, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1946, ""last_played"": 1419718329}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Steam needs a \""meh\"" recommendation option.  I neither loved nor hated Far Cry 4 but at $50-60 I don't recommend this game.  Far Cry 4 feels very much like a really nice expansion pack for Far Cry 3.  A new setting, new characters, but ultimately the same core mechanics.  That's not a knock, I loved Far Cry 3, but I expect more from a full-price AAA title.  Even Assassin's Creed manages to iterate slightly on its gameplay.

13650811,76561198037218165,"Far Cry 4 is basically an updated Far Cry 3, which isn't a bad thing since Far Cry 3 was an outstanding game. I'm going to list the pros and the cons of this game.

Pros:
Beautiful Graphics.
Runs Smoothly After The Recent Patches (Has always ran smooth for me, I play on max settings).
A ton of content: The world is huge, a lot bigger than FC3 and had a ton of missions, guns and customization.
Great Characters (In my opinion).
Map editor is great and there are tons of awesome maps out on the browser.
Nice interface.

Cons:
Multiplayer doesn't run very well and not many people play it.
Gets a tad repetitive, especially after most of the same things were in Far Cry 3.

Overall the game is really fun and enjoyable and I think deserves a positive review.
Verdict: 9/10

Nobody really reads that. It doesn't say \""Only run-able with\"" requirements or \""Use only with.\"" Minimum is more of a lowest \""suggestion\"" that should be running their product. Sure I will be digging a little more about Ubi-made games from this point forward but if you block a certain hardware from running your program at all, inform people that this product will not work with said other products. (Always online DRM lol, well not really related but still lol!)\n\nHaving a community make a mod to atleast run your game is sad. Mods should be for extending game play, not to start up the game because you forgot to mention your game doesn't work with something."", ""timestamp_created"": 1419651365, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419651878, ""voted_up"": false, ""votes_up"": 0, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": 0.5, ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

13626159,76561198039980911,"Far Cry 4, a beautiful enviroment with the great gameplay you've come to love from the series. Far Cry 3 was an amazing game and they deliver with this installment in the franchise and do not fail to let us down. Far Cry 4 takes place in a beautiful area at the base of the himilayas in a place called Kyrat. The story is very good and you get hints and clues about things but it all comes together at the very end of the story, the flowchart to the story is a brilliant creation. Unfortunatly the characters you get to me are under developed and you are under attached to them. close relationships in the story are implied and not developed. I really wanted to actually have good dialogs with Anita but they never happened, they are implied being close, which takes a lot of the weight of the decisions. When i had to make a split decision that alters the story slightly I was more worried about choosing a route that would get me the best ending that actually lining up with the character I agreed with and felt closer to. The co-op and fun arena matches are by far the biuggest selling point of the game, open world co-op with free roam in an expansive beautiful scenery makes the game almost a no brainer to buy.

In summary: Story is very interesting and drawing even with undeveloped characters and little to no character developemnt. The game looks and runs beautifully, your favorite character will be the villian, and Co-op is super fun. overall I give it a 9/10.

Now the interesting part of the game is how Jason evolves as a character, leaving behind his rich kid life style for a hardened merc life. The villian is a great charasmatic center peice for the game and the gun/play and stealth work really well. The game ran well with a solid FPS and had no problems what so ever. also my favorite part was when i realized there were no random flying animal attacks to take out 1/3 of your health for no reason. \n\nOh wait nevermind i clicked on an actually good game."", ""timestamp_created"": 1419613781, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419613781, ""voted_up"": false, ""votes_up"": 3, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.427343875169754028"", ""comment_count"": 5, ""steam_purchase"": false, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

I love Far Cry 3 and I was exited for Far Cry 4 But its been a Disappointment!
But doesn't mean i recommend not buying it like i did.
The Game has to many glitch and issue still need resovling.
It might be a few months before this issues is resolve.

MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE XBOX CONTROLLER CAUSING PROBLEM WHEN PLUG IN

It will cause issue in the game so hopeully they have a patch for that if you like playing with a controller
But the only way to play this game is with a Keyboard which i hate for these type of game

Until then you should wait until the Usbirt fix the issue and who know the game my be cheaper

13579530,76561198006884173,"I enjoyed this game and would recommend it but heres my comments and critiques.

First off the games story is lacking in comparison to Farcy 3. Although Farcry 3 had a pretty amazing storyline and really compelling antagonist (love you vaas) the mechanics weren't in tip top shape. Farcry 4 on the other hand is so smooth with everything, it honestly feels like on big action movie. The map is huge, I only got to the second half of it after 20 or so hours of playing but that was with a decent amount of hours on co-op. 

Pros:
Amazing visuals
Every action is smooth
Driving is still awesome
Co-op is fun
Lots of things to do
Unlock new mechanics as game progesses (instead of all at once)
Spiritual storyline is interesting
Notes are cool to look at
Characters are unique and humorous
Replay value is very existent
Grappling is so niceee

Cons:
Story wasn't as good as Farcry 3
Villain wasn't as good either
Co-op is a little bit glitchy, some things not showing up for both people
Missions get a little repetitive
Didn't like the choose a side thing
Multiplayer is worse than Farcry 3's

I just want to talk about how bad the multiplayer is, first of all they're all objective based, which is lame. I want to just kill people sometimes, also the weapons are pretty restricted and specific to which team you're on. At times it's really hard to connect to a server if you're not using quick play. Odds are if you're buying this game it's for the singleplayer, so I wouldn't be too deterred by this.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR all in all this game is fun and the good definitely outweighs the bad. If you love doing crazy stunts to kill people, like jumping off a mounting to parachute onto a moving truck to hijack it, completely unscripted then this game is for you. It's got some RPG aspects, good storyline, fun combat with the brute or stealthy approach, funny characters and great immersion (i'd highly recommend turning off all interface aside from minimap).

I want to just kill people sometimes, also the weapons are pretty restricted and specific to which team you're on. At times it's really hard to connect to a server if you're not using quick play. Odds are if you're buying this game it's for the singleplayer, so I wouldn't be too deterred by this.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nTL;DR all in all this game is fun and the good definitely outweighs the bad. If you love doing crazy stunts to kill people, like jumping off a mounting to parachute onto a moving truck to hijack it, completely unscripted then this game is for you. It's got some RPG aspects, good storyline, fun combat with the brute or stealthy approach, funny characters and great immersion (i'd highly recommend turning off all interface aside from minimap). \n"", ""timestamp_created"": 1419467604, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419467604, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 6, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.592334926128387451"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

13572212,76561197972792191,"Early in my game I was climbing a mountain, looking over the vast beauty of Kyrat.  A mountain goat was grazing contently nearby, enjoying the lush mountainside grasses.  This serene moment was broken by a loud screech and a massive eagle dove in and snatched the goat in its massive talons.  As the eagle flew off, the goat bleated desperately.

Far Cry 4 is an excellent game and absolutely worth the money. I have no major qualms.

[h1]The longer, unorganized version[/h1]
Includes spoilers

[b]- - - Things I like - - -[/b]

It is a good first person shooter. All the mechanics are there, nothing revolutionary, not much else to say. If the core gameplay aspect was shoddy, which it isn't, the game wouldn't be fun, which it is. 

The game looks great. 

Conquering outposts and fortresses was one of my favorite parts of the game in Far Cry 3, and it is at least as fun in Far Cry 4.

The buzzer is a nifty little gyrocopter / mini helicopter type vehicle held together by duct tape and will power. At first I thought it was overpowered, but as I played the game I found it to be scarce enough so that I couldn't just fly over all the baddies all the time.

The skills are useful and clearly affect gameplay. Aside from the karma boost, all of the skills feel appropriate and as though they belong, some more fun to use than others (I'm talking about riding elephants and chaining takedowns). 

[b]- - - Things that aren't so great, but aren't the end of the world - - -[/b]

The skill groups aren't skill trees. what do I mean by that? The most advanced skills are only preceeded by three mandatory skills and there is no reason to not invest just as heavily in both the Tiger and Elephant skills. This is the one aspect of the game that I feel is inferior to Far Cry 3. In FC3 you had to spend more perks in a single tree to get to the best ones, and it felt more rewarding due to the larger investment.

Guns that you unlock later in the game are, usually, just plain better than the guns you already had. For instance, because I am playing as stealthy as I can, I began the game using the recurve as my primary. However, once I had unlocked the auto crossbow, I had no reason to continue to use the recurve. The auto crossbow fires faster and can still one shot regular enemies; the only downside being that you need to reload occasionally. Not to mention that it is a sidearm, allowing you to free up another weapon slot for, in my case, a grenade launcher. I would have preferred that late game weapons are superior in certain areas, but have drawbacks relative to the early game weapons, giving you more choice.

The Buzzsaw. [i]Sigh.[/i] Sweet mother of overpowered weapons, this one is ridiculous. Aside from lacking a silencer or being able to attach a suppressor to the stock MG42, this gun has the best attributes in every category. Anywhere where you would expect there to be a downside due to an excellent statistic, there isn't. High damage would usually mean a slower rate of fire, but not with the Buzzsaw. Low recoil should be balanced by low accuracy, but not with the Buzzsaw. A massive 400 round magazine would necessitate a slow reload, but not with the Buzzsaw. You get the idea.

Once you have the garden in the Ghale household, you can easily acquire infinite amounts of syringes and money, especially if you have the perk that yields two leaves from every plant you harvest. You reap everything from the garden, craft all syringes you can hold, sell the rest of the leaves, fast travel away, fast travel back. Rinse and repeat.

The way things are resolved with Yuma felt rather anticlimactic.

[b]- - - Things I love - - -[/b]

The grappling hook. Being frequently located throughout the world, it allows convenient movement through Kyrat, yet it is not so common that it becomes gimmicky or repetitive. The dev team executed it perfectly.

The dialogue, as expected, is witty and morbidly hilarious. My favorite lines by far were when Paul ""De Pleur"" Harmon spoke to Ajay from the trunk of his car. Text would not do it justice; someone has a video of it [url=http://youtu.be/vd4p53_powY?t=3m50s]here[/url]. I laughed for a good three minutes.

Speaking of villains, Far Cry 4 delivers some of my favorite antagonists from any game. Paul ""De Pleur"" Harmon, Noore Najjar, Yuma Lau, and of course Pagan Min himself are all characters with multiple layers for you to learn of as you explore Kyrat. I especially like Noore. She was a human rights activist before Pagan captured her family, and then with that leverage he obliged her to do all sorts of horrendous things, including but not limited to human trafficking, operating Pagan's heroine business, and organizing blood sports in the Shanath Arena.

Coop is buggy as hell, but once you get it working it's a riot. You can't do campaign missions coop, but the open world is so much fun to explore as a team. There's nothing more dangerous than a technical with a crazy gunner and a crazier driver. 

The single player experience is every bit as good as Far Cry 3, which was a blast. The gun selection and implementation  are good if you're a gun nerd like me, and the skills are all pretty easy to use and feel powerful. x There are some interesting colorful characters to meet in the world, with occasional chuckle-worthy dialog.

I finished this GIGANTIC game in just a week while I was sick at home. COMPLETLY RECOMMENDED!

That was the first draft which I wrote about a year ago. This is going to be me looking back on it after a year of dissapointment in games (not all games). This game is the best first single player first person shooter created in the last 6 years. I've looked back and there are some amazing games but this is just perfection. It gives you a feeling like you're actually the protagonist of this game. You ARE Ajay Ghale and it's YOUR mission to save the country of Kyrat and give your familes name honor again. YOU're the person blowing up huge statues and shooting down hundreds of people from a helicopter while awesome badass music is playing. No other single player first person shooter has given me this feeling. I would pay twice the amount I did for this game. It's so ammersive you forget you're sitting there in your chair in front of the computer like the loner you are. You become the main character, you choose the destiny of a country, and you blow shit up! GET THIS GAME!

I'm writing this one like years later, once more. I'm now much much much less pasionate about games and don't really care. I remember this game so well, and when I recently went back and played it, it didn't dissapoint. It didn't give me the same feeling it did the first time, but that's because I was 4 years younger and it was one of the first games I had ever played that I didn't first watch a walkthrough of by a youtuber. Looking back, it's still a solid game. Good gunplay, good stealth, good voice acting, good animation, good map, good story, good everything. Is it like as amazing as I sold it as? Nah probably not.

13375048,76561197973214116,"The game is much like Far Cry 3. Same kind of play with similar goals. One thing I did find, and I don't know if anyone else has noticed, the terrain seems the same no matter where you go. I am still in jugle area but I seem to keep going up the same hills, following the same path, no every few hundred yards. I didn't notice this in Far Cry 3, at least not as bad. It seems the designers got lazy and just copied the same area over and over.

As for the game, I have found two major issues. One code related, the other more specific to game play. The big technical issue I've found is that there seems to be a memory leak. The longer you play, the more system RAM is used. I've had it fill up 16GB of memory which caused the game to load very slowly as it needed to manager the reduced memory. Once the game was closed, the memory was released and all was fine again. Poor programming and testing I'd say.

The second issue is with game saves. The game offers the choice to save during a mission but, of course, you loose all of your progress if you quit. If the save feature is not going to save the current progress, block it out or at least make sure you let the player know that the mission will be canceled. At least save to the last check point and let the player resume from there after quiting the game.

There is no Vaas, there's no intruiging villian you constantly run into with amazing dialogue. Sure Pagan Min is there but other than the very beginning and very end you can completely forget about him thought the entire game. To me, the game doesn't emerse you like Farcry 3 did. others may disagree but as of now with no dlc, to be it's lacking.

I'm marking this as not recommended game because of the single save slot. This is a stupid ""feature"" at best as it accomplishes nothing good and potentially lots bad. You can often work around these by backing up your save files independently of the game, but why do I need to do that? Again, there's no advantage, no sense of ""fairness"", etc. There's really no death penalty in the game, so there's nothing that a single save file does for game play.

What a single save file does in a long open world campaign is leave you at risk for corruption. This is particularly bad in this game because they've got a bug that will completely end your campaign that occurs at the very end of one mission just as you transition to a new area in game. I was 40 hours into the game (I tend to do many of the side activities before advancing the campaign missions) when I was bit by this. Many others have been bitten. 

It would be an annoyance if you had multiple saves available. But with a single save AND the fact that it executes that save for you at various points means they built a game designed to have a lot of people abandoning it because they have no desire to repeat the grindier bits in the game.

Back up your files independently and frequently, especially before the ""Willis"" missions.

Single save is built for a world where there are no bugs. That's not the world we live in.

Update:

So a little while ago I managed to get the game to work, and I'm not very impressed with it.

Pros:
- Good Controls.
- Fun Gameplay.
- Interesting Environment.
- WAR ELEPHANTS!!!!!
- Fortresses.

Cons:
- Uninteresting story.
- Not much different than Farcry 3, no real improvemenmts.
- Uninteresting villain and hero.

13329770,76561198030247179,"A review of Far Cry 4 - Post Mortem

Ok, so without saying anything spoiler worthy about the plot I have a few points I need to make about FC4 in general; First, that this game is absolutely gorgeous. I'm not working on the newest of tech as far as computers go (It's a couple of years old and could use some upgrades) but very much like FC3 I found myself distracted by sky lines, filled with commanding mountains and attention grabbing sun sets. Yes, it's super pretty, even on medium graphics.

I also need to point out that the 'how' of how you're going to go about things is more open ended. You can get a wing suit pretty early on, there's grappling hooks, more variety in weapons, and frigging ELEPHANTS (who by the way do not give two blue farts about just about anything in the game and will wreck pretty much anything at your request) and a lot more in the way of sand box toys than the first game, generally speaking.

I felt like a total boss in the game, running around hunting, destroying and otherwise carpet bombing anything I couldn't dig out with a sniper rifle. The game very tongue in cheek draws attention to the fact that you as a player are looking to run around like a vengeful god and smite anything that displeases you. That's not to say the game is unchallenging, because it certainly has it's moments, but for the most part it's you running around dispatching enemies in a geurilla war that takes itself to a level other games have failed to meet.

Plot wise, and character arch wise - Unfortunately no where near as good as FC3. There was a good build up in FC3, Jason Broady, despite being some random white dude dropped into a miserable situation and starts the game consistantly needing a change of pants, eventually gets accustomed to the rampant murder, and eventually is strait up destroying everyone who gets in his path. The ending was a tad more coherent in FC4 than it was in FC3 and leaves you with the feeling of being in control, rather than you being a peon in some grand scheme beyond your understanding, but over all, FC4 plot and character development wise was a far cry less satisfying (Harr harr, I know I'm not funny.) 

Overall, positive experience. Were my hopes up a little high from FC3, maybe. Did I mostly get what I wanted out of the game? Yes. Should you buy it? Ofcourse. Will you have fun; Certainly. Will the plot let you down from the high bar that FC3 set? Probably, but let's be honest, you weren't really in it for the plot to begin with.

13327373,76561198132135433,"Now, I do recommend this game, but first I want to tackle a few things about it. First and FOREMOST, I fully believe that 

this game is criticized a bit too harshly, and here is why.

This game is NOT like Far Cry, ""Three point five"". This is, ""Far Cry 4"". You can disagree all you want, but these are the 

ONLY similarities I have seen.

-One, is the presence of an ""mentally unstable antagonist"".

-Two, a few minor gameplay elements, like the weapon wheel, some of the weapons are the same, or rehashed. 

Nothing cod is NOT RUTHLESSLY guilty of.

-Three, liberating outposts, and fortresses feel like dressed up versions of the last ones in Rook Island.
 
-Four, the tripping out constantly, and being in states of euphoria from drugs, like the mushrooms in the cave, it is like they saw the positive reception of it, than BEAT IT TO DEATH!

Other than that, I did not see many similarities at all honestly. I have NOT tried the PVP, as I cannot stand online play, 

honestly. I buy games to have fun, and unwind, as well as PROPERLY relaxm and enjoy my games.

So I cannot personally tell you much about the PVP segment. The story line is WROUGHT with betrayal, it is FAR too 

overdone! STOP WITH THE BETRAYAL SCENES! All games in this insufferable modern era, are WROUGHT with betrayal.

Personally, despite the four things feeling like, rehashed, and like not enough thought was put in it, it is honestly not 

bad. I mean for god's sake, I was betrayed twice in my campaign playthrough! JUST STOP IT!

Plus, in my opinion, or at least a few times for me, the game seemed to hiccup in certain circumstances. Dropping to 

lower framerates, and sputtering a bit when lots of action occurs on screen. It's negligible,but slightly annoying.

Lets just make this review simple now, shall we.

Pros: 

- Expansive locale, LARGE areas to explore.

- Most of the guns seem fun, The sniper rifle, I believe it is the, ""Z90"" or something, it is AMAZING, and powerful.

I am saying this after 24 hours playing with them, I do not have the season pass, and for some reason, never got the 

harpoon gun with my digital copy.

- The story has some interesting segments, I wish they would curse less, but I think it is marginally less cursing than 3.

To me anyway.

- They make you REALLY feel helpless, like this is a true survival game, even the EAGLES attack you.

- Graphics are decent, but it IS FLAWED, which I will cover in the, ""cons"" part.

- Personally, the pachyderm commandeering is a BLAST! Smashing people with a pachyderm is fun!

- The environment is so large, you NEED to fast travel ,or use the new, ""buzzer"" personal helicopter.

- The buzzer is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Takedowns from it are DIFFICULT, but SO FUN!

- More takedowns, even VEHICLE ones apparently!

Cons:

- There are ZERO positive outcomes, when you REALLY think about it, even the gag ending if you just SIT for thirteen 

minutes at his dinner table, than he returns after an extended period, and you go, and put his mother with Lakshmana.

It is not positive, because despite seeming slightly kind, Pagan IS a dictator.

- STOP WITH THE ACCURSED NUDITY! I am sick of seeing breasts everywhere! Stop objectifying women! I want penises 

in games, if you can show us engaging in deplortable acts of lust filled, delinquent coitus, than you can show a man's 

phallus, and testicles, sorry. But this is sexism to me, just leave the sex out, or put nude men in. Like Outlast, even 

though the twins had mange, and were gross!

- Please omit as much cursing as you can from games, and make an intricate plotline! But one less convoluted than this! 

Shangri-La? Demons? Nirvana? Transformations? WHO IS THE GOAT?!?! THIS BETTER BE COVERED!

-Frame rate drops occasionally, and it can disrupt immersion/effect gameplay minorly. I have been hit, thought it wasn't 

a detrimental wound, than seconds later, my health was gone, after receiving ZERO subsequential shots!

- REALLY ODD, AND INCONSISTENT ANIMAL HEALTH!!!!!!!!!!!! Honey badgers can take 4 ROUNDS from the first bolt 

action rifle. The alloted health, and damage threshold for animals, and some units, is just preposterous.

- You take really peculiar increments of damage for particular outcomes, and various situations. Falling damage seems 

odd as well.

- Some people say, ""Oh Pagan Min is a great guy"" from the gag ending, from what I have seen, NONE of the endings 

TRULY aid Kyrat. Maybe add another, more positive outcome?

- The story, like I said is great. BUT SO CONVOLUTED, and at times, makes ZERO sense!

- Certain things seem like they are copying that god AWFUL cod series. COUGH wingsuit through an avalanche COUGH!

- I am nearing halway through the game, more questions, than answers thus far, I hope the clarify on the, ""Goat"" 

murderer. I hope you at least see him.

- Keep the action, but make it more believable please? Stop trying to emulate cod?
 
- Keep fixing your games Ubisoft, I will support your games, and buy them more.

- Since they have added demons, in my opinion, I hope they go BROADER with the story, if it finishes in this light, and 

pace, it was not original enough. 

- Uninspired, ""demons"". Though, they could of been more interesting, they LOOK cool, till you see their face. DULL!

- Though this game was NOT bad at all! I sort of expected a little more so far, and less betrayal.

A great game, and you will NOT be sorry, just have at LEAST 8 gigabytes of ram, and a DECENT graphics card. Driving is 

ROUGH at first with a keyboard, but you SHOULD get used to it. The wingsuit/parachute comboe is BOUGHT in this one,

it is NOT found like in three. It seems like FAR too many people are using the old adage, ""Sex sells, drop a ladies panties, 

spread her thighs, and show her breasts to make money"" is FAR too prominant here! I am a bisexual woman, but GOD lay 

OFF the sex sells stuff! I watch pornography if I need to for that...

[u]Before you read the good and bad points, I believe it is worth playing but not for $60. Wait until it comes out on sale.[/u]

The Good:
[list]
[*]The gunplay and on-the-fly killing is fantastic with the weapons given.
[*]Elephants are one of the most overpowered things in the game and are great; until you name them and are murdered by a convoy truck that has no intention of stopping.
[*]The wide variety of animals that can be hunted for karma and sold for money makes crafting relatively easy and funding abundant.
[*]The antagonists and the rebels who assist you are well modeled and voice acted, but you only see them in cut scenes.
[/list]

The Bad:
[list]
[*]The framerate is horrendous when you move too fast even with a monster machine on High, not Very High or Ultra. 
[*]Singleplayer Offline Mode rubber-banding. 
[*]Outposts are repetitive and don't offer anything new.
[*]Auto-Drive is an absolutely useless feature in the game that drives you to objectives so you can grab a beer and let the game play itself.
[*]The story is unrewarding for your decisions and everyone you talk to shuts the door on your face or throws you out of a vehicle.
[*]The main character is a bore and is a dope who dopes.
[*]Feels like a reskin of Far Cry 3.

Don't buy it for co-op like my wife and I did, you can't just drop in and start playing together, you each have to beat the entire first chapter of the game before you are even given the option.  No thanks.

Open world can be frustrating because it often leads to, ""Now what?"".  I don't mind having a ton of unimportant quests littered everywhere as long as the important ones aren't something I have to dig and dig to even find.

Looks beautiful, gameplay is mixed, but I only curse at the game every few hours of gameplay...and I don't often curse at games so bear in mind that this has some REALLY rough edges.

The game likes to drop you on your face a lot, metaphorically speaking.  Lots of ""WTF, why am I dying, what am I supposed to do, why doesn't this work?"" moments.  It just drops you in cold rather than introducing you like the developers had heard of a difficulty curve.  Things like climbing out of the ice water onto a dock shouldn't require bouncing in and out of the water while frantically trying to grab onto the dock over and over while you are supposed to be stealthing.  You'll know what I mean when you see this part.  Polish, this game needs lots of polish.  It does work...but oh so roughly.  It is absolutely huge however, so it has a clear emphasis on quantity over quality.

You can almost hear the conversation during development,

""There is a bit of a problem with this part.""

""Is it game breaking?""

""Not completely.""

""Does it look amazing graphically?""

""Well yes...""

""Then why are you bothering me with this?""

This game likes to place you in killboxes too.  Not just ambushes, but areas that provide terrible tactical disadvantage.  Winning a firefight isn't just a game of reflex like a quick draw at high noon, it's about using your environment to your advantage.  Too often however, they forcibly throw away the option for tactics and turn it into a test of your reflexes, but certainly not your brain.  I like the occasional firefight mosh-pit when I choose to rush in, but not when it's the only option that is forced on the player.

The proof's in the pudding, I'm actually planning to finish this game and have made it quite a ways in.  Can't say that about every game I pick up these days so I'll call this not just a good game, but a great one.  Greatly flawed, but still a great game.

Far Cry 4 is basically a re-skin of Far Cry 3, just prettier graphics and different story. The game isn't bad, but it is insanely overpriced. The animations are exactly the same, the weapons are no different, and overall the gameplay is just copy&paste. As far as the story goes, you are Ajay Ghale (don't know if I spelled it right). By your mother's dying wish, you travel to Kyrat to spread her ashes, and what you find yourself in is a civil war between two ""factions"". And you instantly become this hero that destroys everything the dictator (Pagan min) stands for. Like, if you were going to travel somewhere, wouldn't you already know about a civil war? Anyways, it's rushed, you become a war hero within the first 30 mins of the game, which is just like FC3, but FC3 did it better. The characters are weaker, the types of enemies are exactly the same. The game is good, but it is very very overpriced. Nobody should pay 60$ for a re-skin.
Now, the pros&cons for the lazy ones.
Pros:
+Great graphics
+Another very well done main villain
+Rideable elephants
+Decent story
+Good voice acting
+New animals, new vehicles (like 2-3 of each, nothing special).

Cons:
-Copy & paste gameplay from FC3, with the same animations etc. If you were tired of FC3, don't get this one. 
-Weaker characters
-Story feels short, can be repetitive
-Alot more difficult than FC3, for no reason.

Overall, the game is  good, cause it's JUST LIKE FAR CRY 3. If you really want to get this one, do it on sale. Don't end up wasting 60$ on something that should cost 20.

13274159,76561198022619641,"this game was essentially far cry 3 but with two new mode of transportation, which are mini-helicoptors and a climbing with a grappling hook. the story in my mind was pretty lack luster, and the ending was of a more philisophical nature. i personally like philisophical endings, however as mass effect 3 showed, most gamers dont like endings where the ending isnt spelled out for them. the story itself was pretty lack luster, you could skip most of the games quests and you would still be fine with your understanding of the ending. that said there are choices throughout the game and perhaps its just my choices that made most of the games story pretty boring. i would give this game a 6 out of 10 due to its boring nature and rehashing of far cry 3's gameplay, but then you have to consider the bugs i ran into. i finished a mission that took me 15 minutes and then after it was complete the loading screen got stuck. now as a programmer i know that spinners are a sham, but the fake loader added a small chunk every minute to make it seem like its loading.  i actually waited 5 minutes for the bar to finish because i thought it was just loading a custscene or something large. once the loading bar had filled i waited 10 minutes (i walked away from the computer), and when i got back it still hadnt loaded so i had to restart the game and redo the mission. there were also a few other bugs like screen stuttering and eagles cawing rapidly (they caw when they lock on a target, but perhaps they relock on the target when they cant find a path to the target, but i often cant find them so its just this bird really loudly cawing over and over again). the third main issue was the screen stuttering, this game is the same engine as far cry 3 and as such there shouldnt be any issues on my computer, but you can just see the general choppyness as you move through the world. these three issues persisted throughout the entire game and while they didnt hinder me (as in stop me from doing whatever i was doing) that often (except the loading issue, which happend to me about once every 2-6 hours), i still think they are an issue that warrents inclusion on how i rate this game. in short ubisoft needs to get thier shit together and stop releasing piss poor ports on pc and rehashed old games in general (my point that this was basically far cry 3 with a different color pallete and two small features added). this is probably the last far cry game i buy, unless they actually change something about the game or actually take some time to write a good story, and even then ill have to worry about them just releasing it as a shitty port. one last word to the wise, i regretted buying this game, if you want this kind of game but havent played far cry 3 then buy far cry 3, if you want far cry 4 then wait till its at least 50% off if not 75% off (i found far cry 3: blood dragon more fun, and its far cheaper). in short, bugs included,

I have just completed the campain and I can't help but feel so many emotions. Besides the next generation graphics that are just stunningly beautiful, the awesome immersive action, and meticulous map design; the story was really outstanding and the decisions you had to make thought inducing. This isn't like most campaigns where you just go from point A to point B. This really questions your morals, and what you believe in and really makes you feel one with the world around you. It is a rare thought provoking game where there is no correct choice, only decisions. There are a few flaws, superficial at best, but other than that I rate this a 11/10. I have never reviewed ANY game before but I had to review this. This was one of my most cherished gaming memories from the hundreds of games I've played. So please:  PLAY THIS GAME.

13263469,76561197995562354,"First, the bad: In some respects, Far Cry 4 stepped back from Far Cry 3 (weaker characters, underuse of an awesome main villain, story didn't make sense). Probably the weakest part of the game was the story. I'm one of those guys who really liked the story and themes of Far Cry 3 - it made me stop and think how insane it was that I was running around committing mass-murder. At the beginning of the game, you were conflicted about it, and the game addressed how you were changing and how your allies were concerned.... Well, there's none of that in Far Cry 4. You go into Kyrat with the simple cause of scattering your mothers ashes, but quickly start shooting 90 percent of all the people you see in cold blood for no reason. The game never addresses exactly why Ajay Ghale wants to kill these people. He even acknowledges this at several points. Worse, he acts really snobbish when he talks to the crazy people on the Island, like he's above them somehow - but he's the one who's shooting up hundreds of people for absolutely no reason - at least the other characters know why they're there. In trying to make the main character less overbearing, Ubisoft has simply made him unlikeable.

But now for the good! In many respects, Far Cry 4 IMPROVED upon Far Cry 3! The world is much denser, more lively, and packed with things to do. It's full of verticality, it's graphically beautiful - and that's why I got the game - if you're mainly getting this game for the open world gameplay, you'll be very pleased. The co-op is wonderful; you can do everything in the world that you could do in singleplayer mode. It's just plain awesome. The open world is so perfect that I can completely ignore the crappy story and weak characters - if I want a story driven gaming experience with no world freedom, I'll buy Call of Duty (except I won't). Far Cry 4 is a giant explosive sandbox where you can have fun and do whatever you want for hours on end. With friends!

13258489,76561198090958008,"skyrim with guns and great gameplay. however i had the worst experience ever during the actual download. first it took 2 whole days for some reason and ya i have a good internet conection and every 5 mins the download would stop for no reason and would need to be manually started again. and this is the kicker.... i was at 20.6 gig of 21 and steam closed its self for no reason and when i open again its back to 9gig of 21............... FFS i also have some screenshot if some cool looking rainbow cliff  faces that are obvious graphics issues. so i verify my game cache and WOW gota re download 11gig..... HOLY $HIT GOOD JOB!          but despite all this the game is great an i still give a thumbs up.

OK update ive now played this game 20hrs and have spent much longer than that just trying to get the game working properly. at the time i wrote this review i had to re-download 11.1 gb for some reason failed to validate, i played the game for 5 mins closed it down and tried to re-open next day and OMFG on startup its saying FC4.dll is fucking corrupt and may bee infected by a virus.......... which its really not.......  SO AGAIN I HAVE 10.9 GB TO DOWNLOAD and the total for the game should be 21BG, ive now had to download over 60GB LIKE HOLY F@@@ im close to demanding my money back.. but hey gameplay is still good isnt it? oh and i blame steam for sending me files that fail to launch game the VERY FIRST TIME. when u download this before u even play it verify the integrity of your game cache unless u want you save file corrupted to the point that its useless after having made it 30% through the game. appologies about typos i have 1 hand atm lol
so just now verified again, it failed, 10.6gb later i get this.
  ""FILE CORRUPTED! This program has been manipulated and maybe its infected by a Virus or cracked. This file wont work anymore."" NO IT HASENT. like wow really?
another addition i would like to add is after a complete uninstall and re-install trying to play the game i noticed there wasent gound anywhere...... just rocks, building, and grass floating in the air and every time the charactor spawed, would simple start falling through the map as the ground wasent there. so now i try to validate and 7 files now fail to validate and 11.7GB 
IVE DOWNLOADED 90+GIG AND THE GAME STILL DOESENT #@%$ING WORK

FFS i also have some screenshot if some cool looking rainbow cliff  faces that are obvious graphics issues. so i verify my game cache and WOW gota re download 11gig..... HOLY $HIT GOOD JOB!          but despite all this the game is great an i still give a thumbs up.\n\nOK update ive now played this game 20hrs and have spent much longer than that just trying to get the game working properly. at the time i wrote this review i had to re-download 11.1 gb for some reason failed to validate, i played the game for 5 mins closed it down and tried to re-open next day and OMFG on startup its saying FC4.dll is fucking corrupt and may bee infected by a virus.......... which its really not.......  SO AGAIN I HAVE 10.9 GB TO DOWNLOAD and the total for the game should be 21BG, ive now had to download over 60GB LIKE HOLY F@@@ im close to demanding my money back.. but hey gameplay is still good isnt it? oh and i blame steam for sending me files that fail to launch game the VERY FIRST TIME. when u download this before u even play it verify the integrity of your game cache unless u want you save file corrupted to the point that its useless after having made it 30% through the game. appologies about typos i have 1 hand atm lol\nso just now verified again, it failed, 10.6gb later i get this.\n  \""FILE CORRUPTED!

1.7.0 with some tweaking it is finally running good. It suffers from micro stutter all the time but somewhere middle on the road I forgot about that. Getting over all this technical hassle it's the best FarCry so far. Just finished it with a big smile. :) Recommended. Finally.

Update:
The 1.5.0 patch renders it playable for me. Thanks Ubisoft for using the mouse as a ... I think we call it ""Pointing Device"" now ... and not as a ""Joypad Emulator"". 
The stuttering is still there, ruining every single second of the game. Can I recommend it now? NO! What we have here is the absolute MINIMUM what you can expect from a game! At least it ""runs"" now and -- hell yeah -- I have a chance of actually controlling it!
I expect that this current state is taken by Ubisoft as ""the finish line"" (like in Watch_Dogs). If you are in desperate need of your next FarCry fix and able to throw massive amounts of hardware power at the game (Desktop GTX980) -- feel free to take a look at it.

13247437,76561198087931901,"FarCry4 это прекрассная игра, лучшый шутан с полной свободой действий за несколько лет. Ожидая эту игру я точно знал что получу, и игра полностью оправдала мои ожидания.

Из плюсов:
В игре невероятно красивый мир, первый раз поподая в Кират ты такой думаешь - Дак ведь это Скайрим!!! Однако получив свой первый ствол, все асоциации отпадают сразу, невероятное внимание к деталям акружения, разнообразные храмы руины, статуи, везде развешанные флажки, пряпки, неписи же ведут себя обыденно как и обычные индийцы, ходят полуголые ракрашенные красками и курят что-то сидя в кампании макак.
Обыденные фишки от Ubisift так же из серии FarCry захват аванпостов, любимые всем колокольни(вышки), много очень много разнообрвзных необязательных заданий, 
Сюжет интересный, не то чтобы прям достоен какой либо премии но на 4-ку, местами дает немного поаргазмировать от происходящего на экране. 
Так же в игре появилась, какая не какая нелинейность. ~3 концовки. Причем получить одну из них можно в первые 15 минут игры=D ""-Не уходи попробуй крабовый рангун""
Персонажи все персонажи, чертовско хорошо проработаны, видно что над этим сильно запарились, их просто нравится слушать. Амита, Сабал, Пол, Нур, Аджай, Пейган, Еги и Реджи, Лонгин, Херк все круты обсолютно все, даже если они появлялись на считанные минуты, они запоминались.
Геймплей все что я могу сказать, он есть в этой игре и его дохрена. Невероятная фауна, чего только стоят орлы и медоеды, вы от этих тварей еще испытаете столько боли, что тигр или медведь вам покажутся домашними зверушками а большая стая волков так пустячек. И не как нельзя не упамянуть слонов и носорогов, это просто машины для убийства врагов и уничтожения техники. В Кирате вас будет старатса убить абсолютно все, любая божя тварь, будь то солдат или рыба в озере.
Что до основных врагов, солдат Пейгана ребята поумнели, стали хорошо видеть, хорошо слышать, замечают потерю бойца, реагируют на обстановку, когда их много они рашат а когда мало стараются зашкерится или обойти со спины. Так же добавили пару классов врагов по сравнению с 3 ей частью.
Куча транспортных средств от вертолетов и разнообразных машин до костюма крыла который позволяет в любой момент карабкаясь по скале (Да в игре офигенная система скалолазанья.) взмыть воздух як птица и забрать пару врагов словно орел=D

Из минусов, они не кретичны но все же:
Тот же костюм крыло, он немного кривой и ГГ всегда норовит его открыть с небольшой высоты и разбить себе чучоло об ближайшее дерево или стену. А бывали моменты когда ты зависаешь в воздухе и не теряешь высоту летаешь вечно пока не врежешься в гору.
В некоторых местах зайдя в здание вы можете увидить такое чудо Кирата как прозрачные стены, ""Нанотехнологический Институт Кирата"" посторался видать. Было это всего 2 ва раза.
Так же иногда очень редко зависает HUD и не отображает некоторые елименты или некорректно, но такое бывало тоже пару раз за ~40 часов игры.

Ну вот мой вердик пожалуй:
Добротная игра для неоднократного прохождения по хардкору.

Buggy is an understatement, infested would be more accurate.  Coop isnt even playable, 2 weeks in.  During coop play, if your not the host half the vehicles dont show up.  You will see the host jumping down the road at a rapid clip.  There are enemy convoys that you are supposed to either destroy or hijack.  The host can see them, not the client.

The description of it being a coop game was very misleading.

13234649,76561198046369686,"First Review ever, so I just thought I'd throw in a few of my thoughts:

Imagine a world wrought with conflict, exploration, and an attractive appeal unlike any other. A world of vast snowy mountains, civil war, and dangerous wildlife. A world where nature itself can be your greatest friend or your worst enemy, and the decision between life and death lies between the choices one makes. 

Such is the world of Far Cry 4, the vast, over the top open world first person shooter developed by Ubisoft.

With a sense of adventure unmatchable by many games to have recently come out, Far Cry 4’s diversity of utility and sense of exploration easily make it one of the most enjoyable games of the year. Yet despite this, the lack of direction and focus, along with the confusing narrative aspects of the game, restrict it from being something truly outstanding.

Probably one of the most mixed aspects of the game lies in the story’s plot and characters. It’s a typical, if not cliche, storyline. The player plays as Ajay Ghale, an American of Kirati descent who comes to his parent’s native land of Kyrat to scatter his mother’s ashes. Along the way, he is swept up in a civil war between the country’s charismatic dictator, Pagan Min, and the rebel group which oppose him, the Golden Path. 

While one of the positive aspects of the game’s story comes in the form of being able to utilize choice in order to determine the outcome of the story, a negative aspect stems in the lack of clarity that some of these story missions have. There’s not really a sense of explanation about why something happens, such as Ajay’s remarkable ability of suddenly being able to use an elephant as the world’s largest battering ram, and as a result it leaves players muddled and confused.

Furthermore, the inconsistency with the performance of the game’s characters inhibits the flow of the story. 

One of the most noticeable would be Pagan Min, the self proclaimed dictator of Kyrat. He is as insane as he is logical, as civilized as he is barbaric, and because of this easily becomes of the most memorable characters within the game. Despite this, he doesn’t get enough screen time to truly flush him out as a character, and his inconsistent appearances truly dampen his amazing qualities.

Fortunately though, regardless of the lack of direction and unclear characters that Far Cry 4 introduces, the massive and jaw dropping world of Kyrat for which the game takes place in more than makes up for these faults. 

There’s always so much to do in the fictional landscape, whether that be exploring the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas, hunting in the dense and dangerous forests, or even attacking enemy bases to take for oneself. All of this feeds into the game’s remarkable ability of having these events matter, as the rewards for accomplishing side tasks lead to a more memorable game experience. Pelts taken from hunted animals can be used to craft tools which help aid the character, while money looted from enemy outposts can be used to buy new and more destructive weapons. In fact, many of the off hand missions which don’t necessarily follow the main story are the ones that players end up really remembering.

This transitions well into the game’s online aspect, as cooperative play with friends and competitive 
multiplayer carry the same insane, never ending action seen in single player. 

These events truly showcase the world of Kyrat which Ubisoft wanted it to be, and what a world it is. 

From the mountainous lakes and unpredictable events which occur in the game’s wilderness, to the humble villages and simple tribesmen who inhabit the land, the world of Kyrat is not only memorable because it’s gorgeous, but because it’s a living and breathing embodiment of the game’s uncivilized spirit. 
	
All in all, Far Cry 4 is one of the more enjoyable games to come out this winter. 
Despite the inconsistent qualities within the game's characters and narritive, the colorful and interactive land of Kyrat is an interactive advenure which shouldn't be missed.",1417758179,1417990613,1,0.4700891077518463,2473,1399,1545984565,"{""recommendationid"": ""13234649"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198046369686"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 1, ""playtime_forever"": 2473, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1399, ""last_played"": 1545984565}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""First Review ever, so I just thought I'd throw in a few of my thoughts:\n\nImagine a world wrought with conflict, exploration, and an attractive appeal unlike any other.

In fact, many of the off hand missions which don’t necessarily follow the main story are the ones that players end up really remembering.\n\nThis transitions well into the game’s online aspect, as cooperative play with friends and competitive \nmultiplayer carry the same insane, never ending action seen in single player. \n\nThese events truly showcase the world of Kyrat which Ubisoft wanted it to be, and what a world it is. \n\nFrom the mountainous lakes and unpredictable events which occur in the game’s wilderness, to the humble villages and simple tribesmen who inhabit the land, the world of Kyrat is not only memorable because it’s gorgeous, but because it’s a living and breathing embodiment of the game’s uncivilized spirit. \n\t\nAll in all, Far Cry 4 is one of the more enjoyable games to come out this winter. \nDespite the inconsistent qualities within the game's characters and narritive, the colorful and interactive land of Kyrat is an interactive advenure which shouldn't be missed."", ""timestamp_created"": 1417758179, ""timestamp_updated"": 1417990613, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 0, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.470089107751846313"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

The game is awesome you got a ton of cool stuff like the vehicle takedown,cool new weapons,throwing knifes or the sticky explosive upgrade and the graphic it's just sometimes I have to make a screenshot of the game and use it as a wallpaper it's beautiful.
The sidequests are great fun and (in my opinion) stealth in gernal.
You get more chances to use stealth.
But there's also a bad part.
I don't like it personaly..you can't realy do stealth at the begining of the game because of the bad weapons and missing skills for it and the story is a bit confusing.
I found around 5 bugs/glitches in game, wich is kinda sad.
The price is a bit high especially if you buy it in the gold edition like I did. :D
I didn't play Multiplayer/Coop yet.
6/10 stars


Compared to FC3:

Sure you got this ton of new stuff like a crossbow and the stuff I wrote down in the normal review and this great graphic ,more fun in sidequests ,but It's just in my opnion..I don't like the story.
In my opinion fc3 was a better game...better story doesn't just make a better game I know ,but I just had that great feeling in fc3 the whole time I played it through.
I also just wanted to continue playing fc3 ,because of the great story.
It feels more like the whole game fc4 builds on the sidequests and that's in my opinion a bit wrong.


So If you wanna play stealth ,action and a great open world game ,grab fc4.
If you are more up for the story ,you should at least try it.

(small spoiler at the end)
Willis comes back to fc4.

Thought:
I think the next far cry will play in Russia or something like that ,because Willis was at Rook Island first and gets to Kyrat and he said in fc3 that he's on his way to Russia and will have to get some fuel near Singapure.

Like many people I loved far cry 3 and that led me to buy this. I did read the reviews first and have to say I haven't had any of the stated issues... perhaps because I waited until after a couple patches to start playing.

As far as bugs go, I'm playing on an older laptop so while I could handle skyrim on ultra this I stick to medium and turn to low for races and some missions that cant be done stealthily. For me it's not an issue though since I have horrible vision and like farcry specifically because I can finish most of the game with a sniper rifle on a ledge without ever being spotted. So no black screens, frame rate and loading screens were fine.

Little things like a few missing frames or one time I rope swung myself into the floor were minor things and surprisingly rare for an open world this size. 

The most annoying thing for me just has to do with luck. For some reason during races cars are always stopped in the center of the circles making finishing races a matter of luck on what loads where rather than skill. And one time while really far into a rock climb an eagle picked up a goat and dropped it on my head causing me to fall and curse not being able to save.

Other issues where people have stated having to rewatch cut scenes has never happened to me, even when I die it starts after the cut scene. Rather I think there aren't nearly enough cut scenes... I'm over halfway through currently and trying to sparse out my quests with dialogue. But I'm one of those crazies who reads every note and letter I find.

As for the game not being populated enough: someone mentioned only running into two people and I just don't see how that is possible, I can't drive ten meters without running some poor screaming villager off the road not to mention trying to take out outposts before your team drives up the road and starts a gun fight.

As for uplay don't expect much... it won't sync for me but I play offline anyways, for someone who wants to play online and expects it to work that may be an issue.

Yes Uplay sucks, Yes it crashes, Yes it doesn't load, Yes it's a console port, Yes Yes Yes....
If the game works pretty well on the Majority of peoples' computers, then it's a decent game, not perfect, but decent.

SPECS:
Quad-Core i7 3770k 3.4GHz
8 GB RAM
GTX 770 4VRAM
600W
Windows 8.1

The game works fine for me (Very High - 60fps, NVIDIA - 30fps) and looks fucking gorgeous, better than every game out there.
Gameplay is fuild and the AI is somewhat threatening, not super smart by any means.
Sound and menu design is creative, though it's a console port but it's very user friendly.
Storyline is very engaging and action packed, some people say Far Cry 3's storyline is superior. I disagree. Jason, The main charachter IS better than the Ajay, and Vass IS crazier than Pagen, but the storyline feels much more realistic, reasonible amd mature, and it doesn't include FUCKING QUICK TIME EVENTS. Final mission build-up is epic and better than FC3's as it should be, and it matches the mission very well.
Game is escorted by beatiful, graphicaly-impressive cinematical Cut Sences, which are fun to watch and listen to (without skipping option D:)

Final Verdict:

I disagree. Jason, The main charachter IS better than the Ajay, and Vass IS crazier than Pagen, but the storyline feels much more realistic, reasonible amd mature, and it doesn't include FUCKING QUICK TIME EVENTS.

Overall the story leaves much to be desired.  Co-op is a step up from FC3, but the bugs in co-op are even worse than single player and tend to ruin most sessions one way or another, or if not ruin, significantly reduce the fun of a session.

The game is just riddled with dissapointing bugs, and really strange upgrade recepies. Five Rhino hides for a wallet? How fucking big is this wallet?

High DPI mouse will be very low, since this is quite obviously a console port. You can tell by the complete dog shit menus and the terrible response for snap aiming and turning. Not much in the way for setting to fix this either.

SAVING? You get ONE save file, and a backup of a save from earlier one. Ubi mannages this. You do not. You have no choice where it autosaves/quicksaves. Which could be a problem if its in the middle of a place you dont want to be and for some reason, the main save doesnt work. if you try to make a new save, FC4 asks for you to start a new game. HF W/ That.

FOV is more like a joke, since there is just a bar with no actual scale of how much you are changing. That means there is a bar, but no numbers to realisticly judge how much of a FOV you are adjusting your games FOV to.

The sounds are great though, so a nice headset will do you some justice. The combat, however, is terribly random. Sometimes you can hump a dudes leg and they wont see you, other times they see you through a wall. Bad AI, especially with animals.

Animals....yes...you will find you are under nearly constant barrage from eagles, wolves, tigers, and rhinos through out the game. Every fucking squirrel in the univers is trying to stuff its nuts in your mouth. The only shit that wont try to kill you when it magically spawns behind you is an Elephant. You know? The most agressive territorial animal in the world aside from Humans.

On the up side, this fag you play isnt Jason Brody, but he looks like a complete fucktwat douchebag anyhow. Not like the strong, strapping lad I saw in the pre-release trailer for FC4. That dude looked prime. This guy looks like some college football benchwarming dick sucker.

Crashing. Youll find a place you can go, or a mission you are forced to do that takes you to one of those special little unique areas...and you cant go back....and you CTD every time you try to get through it...This game has tons of shit like that, and all sorts of messed up shadow glitching, and silouette effects that make the entire world blacker than the globe trotters. Even High End PC's have been having issues like this. That is, if you can even start the game. (Check the forums for complaints about not being able to start the game on seriously good hardware.)

Ubisoft and UPlay. You are forced to deal with both. The game comes with a warning on it mentioning this. It doesnt change the fact that Ubisoft isnt giving two fucks about patching any issues except ones they are forced to fix by law and threat of legal action. But instead of doing all they could to make this a decent console port, they shit all over the PC community again and quite openly said ""We dont care about PC users anyhow, they are all Pirates."". I dont have to explain that UPlay is the same shit as steam its just not Steam. Which is fucking retarded because if I wanted to play this game from UPlay I wouldnt have got it on Steam in the first place. Third party DRM bullshit ect ect. 

Its a pretty game, to sum it up, but it has issues and some serious debates on Ubisoft justifying their verbal slander towards PC users. If you use a PC they already insulted you, even if they dont have your money yet. And if you bought a game or two from them, they already told you to go fuck yourself. You decide if its worth it.

BUT…..

I have to say that this game is the most fun I have had in a long time. This game has so much to do that sometimes I find difficulty in deciding what I want to do next.  It feels like Skyrim with modern weapons. Sure not much has changed from Far Cry 3 but really is that a bad thing?

Some of the new things I enjoy are the Buzzer (small helicopter). It is a blast flying around the world exploring or shooting a sidearm grenade launcher from the skies. The open world coop does have some limitations in regards to progression etc but if you just want to take down some outposts with a friend it is amazing. No longer is coop limited to separate missions in separate maps like Far Cry 3 was. You get to play in the same world.

13207560,76561198080330838,"   Let me just start of by saying that Far Cry 4 is a great experience, that if you loved Far Cry 3, then this is a must play for you. Unlike many players im very new to the Far Cry series as i only beat Far Cry 3 a couple of days before Far Cry 4 came out, but this game is amazing. This game is very much like Far Cry 3, but thats not a bad thing, its a great thing actually. The combat is stellar, the hunting has been improved significantly, the user interface is friendlier, and the map is huge with many things to do and places to explore. Kyrat provides some fresh changes, with the many mountains and ridges to climb and summit, the map is really great in that way, if you see something, you can probably go there. The only walls are when you are trying to go over mountain tops in the solo copter thing, which i find a bit annoying how they force you to go around.
   Now, Pagan Min... is a great villan. I know i wasn't the only one that was unsure how he would match up to Vaas and his definitin of insanity deal (seriously that is still stuck in my head, probably my favirote villan ever), but Pagan Min does a great job of captivating your interests, but also showing a dark side in his actions/dialogue. He was clearly not just put together, but rather worked on extensivley to give the game a new cover villan.
   One thing i would like to speak about that i really like in the game is the grey areas, no not actual physical areas, but the choices you make in the game. When you fight for the rebelion you make several choices, each having their own cons and benifits. It would actually make me stop playing for a minute so i could really think it over, as there was no clear cut ""right choice"" in my mind as they both had major flaws and benifits. It forces you to value what you want for Kyrat, knowing that other things such as long-standing tradition or future economic prosperity might be sacrificed. It leaves you with this feeling of "" did i make the right call there?"" which is a great immersive tool to use, and i hope its used like this in gaming future.
  Now, Ajay Ghale... this is where i have some complaints. Before i start, the environment, all the characters, are perfect, so much so that Ajay stands out as well... kind of bland to be honest. I mean, i feel his imporatance in Kyrat, it is clear that people know of him and his family, which is a really cool change in the series, than being some unknown gunman who makes a name for yourself, your name is already set, just how are you going to live it? This is a great premise, but i found myself being underwhelmed a few times by Ajay. I mean whenever i hear his voice, he just seems like hes always bored or uninterested in whats going on, which is really a confusing contrast from his strong willingness to help the rebellion. This is a flaw i feel should have been adressed as Ajay is the main character, and how we experience the story. His actions say he is a very motivated convicted individual fighting for a cause, but his voice makes it seem like he just wants to watch sitcom reruns on his couch. Maybe im just nitpicking here, but it is the one flaw i feel should be adressed in this AMAZING game.
   Now should you get this game? HELL YES, it has some flaws, but if you loved Farcry 3, youll love this game.
Sidenote: How is it that everyone of the main protagonists in Far Cry are just automatic killing machines, i mean the first 2 it makes sense knowing their backgrounds, but Jason in Far Cry 3 was scared half to death when he stabbed someone for the first time, then the next day hes an expert in all weapons.

PROS
- Awesome story line
- Beautiful graphics and amazing looking terrain
- No longer stutters for me maybe like 5% of the time, but thats very tiny
- Love the new weapons
- Love that you're finally being hunted by people who use bows
- Decisive main character
- Enemies are definitely harder as they sense me even if I look up just a bit which gives it a sense of challenge.
-I'm getting 50-70 fps which is definitely good.
Cons
- Only 1 problem, I'm still getting small black screen flashes for like half a second randomly. But overall it really doesn't bother me. Not at all really.

First of all, if you had experienced dizziness in the past, you'd better reconsider buying this game. I didn't have any problem on Far Cry 3, but I got some serious dizziness on Far Cry 4. You can't adjust it with FOV. You'll get narrow-vision with low FOV, which triggers  dizziness. And you'll get twisted vision with high FOV, which also triggers  dizziness. I understand that they tried to pursue vivid, realistic vision, but it became rather limited & distorted vision.

Horrible porting to PC, especially it has serious problem with mouse controlling. This game is basically constructed as a console game, so it works well with PC+Pad(controller). but I can't say the same about PC+mouse. They didn't port it properly to mouse controlling system. People call it 'sticky control', which feels like there's some peanut butter under the mouse. You can't move your sight as you want, and can't get any decent aim on enemies. It's not adjustable by mouse acceleration, or mouse sensitivity. I've played FPS games like Far Cry, Borderlands, Battle Field, Call of Duty, Counter Strike series which all have decent mouse controlling systems, and I've played them only with mouse. Until Far Cry 3, devs clearly done perfect porting work to PC&mouse, but on Far Cry 4, they didn't do their work properly. 

Many fanboys are saying that they can tolerate and adapt to this mouse problem, cause game is too great. But I don't think that makes any sense. So do you mean that devs are too tired to do the proper porting to PC & mouse system, so we have to shut up and suck it up? or buy a new PAD(controller) to play this game?They released this game for PC, and sucking tons of money from PC users, and it's supposed to work properly on PC & mouse. If they didn't have technical ability to port it to PC & mouse, they shouldn't have released it to PC market. Or at least they had to set some explicit limit on the hardware conditions like ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons: requires a controller to play"". I guess it's a bit intentional for their market strategies, but let's not say further. The fact I can confirm you is that they did horrible porting work to PC & mouse system.

I got a refund on this game. Since steam doesn't provide refund or return service, I received $59.99 Steam Wallet Credit. And it was applied as a 1-time limited customer service gesture. If you're not sure about this game, try it on Origin. You can get a full money refund in 24H there.

13194010,76561198002148471,"The game is pretty entertaining to play. The open world shooter platform is fun, the vehicles in the game are pretty interesting (other than they all go the exact same speed), and the grappling hook in a mountanious terrain makes running around and exploring worthwhile. The weapons and the customizations with them are also entertaining, but the skills leave a lot to be desired (I ended up having stacks of 10 skill points saved up because I couldn't spend them due to some skills requiring mission unlocks). 

The characters in the game are for the most part good, but there's also some dialog scenes and character development that have their WTF moments. I would say in all the missions were relatively entertaining, albeit very adult in nature. The in-game currency is also valuable as you use it to buy weapons / ammo, and it is possible to run out of it, but not likely.

With all that said, lets get to the bugs / oversights in the game (and I'm sure I'm missing a lot too).

First, you can't easily switch weapons after starting a mission. So if your mission requires that you need a rocket launcher to take out a vehicle, there's no real way to get one other than trekking back to an outpost to switch weapons to a rocket launcher, which isn't fun at all, or sometimes impossible if you die and you are at a checkpoint which wont allow you to go back.

Second, the keybinds don't make sense for someone with keyboard and mouse. Like, you can press and hold Q, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and bring up the weapon select popup window, but you can't bind individual weapons or slots to any of those keys... makes no sense. The game was designed with a controller in mind, but they could have put in the extra 2 hours of thought to do it better. I could be wrong on this, but if it is possible, it's not intuitive at all. 

Third, I'm going to go into a lot of multiplayer issues, and this section is pretty long. To start, how the hell do you make a multiplayer game that has no chat. I know there's a voice chat feature, but I've never been able to get it to work. I've only had one guy talk to me in game, and even though my binds are correct and my mic works, I couldn't talk back to him. If this one feature worked correctly, or if there was text chat, the game would be infinitely more enjoyable. It sucks when you're playing with someone and you can't discuss tactics to conquer an outpost of complete a mission. Huge oversight / mistake. This makes the game quite frustrating in practice. Next up, lets talk about the FOV when riding as a passenger in a vehicle. I don't know if this bug is due to me having the FOV cranked up to the highest setting, but whenever I ride as a passenger in a vehicle, unless I am zooming/scoping a gun from the passenger seat, my FOV changes to something like 180, and it looks like I'm viewing the game through an extreme fisheye lens. This makes me pretty nauseas when it happens, and vehicle travel is essential in the game. This leads to another common problem... half the time in multiplayer, my keybinds wont work... example: I can't enter a vehicle, there's no little popup to let me get in the vehicle, and if I press the key to normally get in a vehicle, I can't get in it. I have to completely restart the game to fix this sometimes, and with the way the game is setup, you can't just start playing with the same person again, it's off to search for another partner in matchmaking and hope it doesn't happen again. This bug happens about 50% of the time I play coop, which is stupid. It's not limited to entering vehicles... I've had my camera key stop working, the key to switch weapons stop working, almost every every in-game bind stop working except for maybe WASD, thats about it. Hugely disappointing. Then there's the ammo bug, where you'll enter a game with full ammo in multiplayer, and then have a fraction of that ammo available. So you go and refill your ammo (which is quite expensive), and then have the same thing happen again the next game. I realized after paying a ton of money to refill my ammo and saying forget it, that if I waited for a long enough time in game, my ammo would magically appear. Pretty frustrating to say the least.

In conclusion, I'd say the game was probably not worth the money. The bugs / game oversights I mentioned above really turned me from someone who liked the concept of the game into someone who isn't a huge fan of the devs / ubisoft for what they left out. Just the lack of multiplayer chat is a gameplay dealbreaker, and tie that in with the bugs I listed and the ones I forgot about, and you get a half-baked game release. I'd say still get the game if you like what you've seen in trailers / gameplay, but wait till it goes on sale and hope they fixed the bugs.",1417508326,1417508326,0,0.5090370774269104,3337,3337,1417684323,"{""recommendationid"": ""13194010"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198002148471"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 2, ""playtime_forever"": 3337, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 3337, ""last_played"": 1417684323}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""The game is pretty entertaining to play.

13190107,76561198018791012,"Far Cry 4 is an excellent sequel to an all time favorite FPS, open world, exploratory game of mine, Far Cry 3. 

However, this game is not without sin. 

Ubisoft, get your shit together and start respecting PC Gamers. We are a loyal fan base and the nice thing to do is Port correctly. Along the same lines, don't release things unfinished and have to resort to releasing multiple patches after release to make the game even playable for some. This game is horrendous when it comes to PC optimization requiring a near supercomputer to run at the highest settings (An issue Far Cry 3 never had).

Storywise, this game is completely brilliant, unlike anything I've seen in regards to Open World Shooters. Sidequests, exploration, interactive enviorments are all a plus. But I couldn't help but notice how un-innovative this game is compared to Far Cry 3. There's a new map for sure. New animals, new obstacles, new guns, ect. But other than the basics which get old quickly, there isn't any new innovation here. Everything from vehicles, crafting, hunting, photos tagging, it's all a direct copy from the prior. Very disappointing considering how new and well done Far Cry 3 was. 

In conclusion, Ubisoft, these titles and series are great, well thought out and executed for the most part, but I fear for your future. You disregard loyal fan bases, push out games before they are ready, and lack creativity when it comes to your titles. You are a studio that has revolutionized in the past, but this game has noticable corners cut, which is not what I expect of Ubisoft, a company with great potential.

13189864,76561198026387705,"Well, I recommend this game, cause it give you what  you can expect: Fun, action and good graphics. You deal with quests in different approaches like slow, fast, hard or in stealth. There are manny quests, different side quests and a lot collectables. There are nice water places, like falls, rivers or springs. Nice mountains and a very good background.

But there are some things they could have done better.

The enviroment looks often the same especially the trees. The trees and bushes have the same density everywhere. Where are the plains, the forests or single tress or small groups of trees?

After a while, when you got the AI of the NPCs, it becomes easy. I mean, an easy beginning is always not bad. But I have expected more. E.g. a hostege situation or a fortress. If I kill one, OK. But after the second sniper kill, I would call reenforcements, or kill the hostages, right? A stealth appraoch means no one sees my attack. Isn't it so hard to tell the AI to send two men after a noise? Or even harder an additional sniper whatching these two? This would have been really hard to solve. By fast shooting, good hiding, using mines or C4....

And the story... OK. But why not summarizing your decisions over the quests in a final video (e.g. Fallout). I would have been a nice reflextion of what I did and how it changed Kyrat. And where are the atvantages of collection all the letters and such. A final quest for this like ""Hey you found all the letters. Now the story makes sense and we can go to the secret cave...""

Run #2 The door leading to the guy getting tortured did not open so I had to go back to the previous checkpoint
Run #3 Guy was not being tortured so I went back to the previous checkpoint
Run #4 I could not pick up items so I went back to previous checkpoint
Run #5 The guy was not being tortured, I alt-tabbed to attempt to look up a fix. Moment I alt-tabbed the guy somehow ended up strapped to the board and I could finally progress. After the next room I went outside and nothing was happening, no truck existed, I could run through the main gate and down the road, could even drive one of the small vehicles down it. Went back to previous checkpoint.
Run #6 The firefight actually proceeded and I got into the truck, nothing happened at this point.
Run #7 Next thing I know an elephant is in front of me and the truck is driving away.

Just getting out of the compound took me 7 attempts? This game is complete garbage, just like the parent company these past few years. I would not recommend it to anybody.

Just for all the loser fanboys who want to cry about how it is probably my computers performance, I will list a bit of my specs.

Windows 7 Ultimate Edition (64-bit)
32 GB of Aries series G.skill Ram
AMD 3.6 ghz 8-core processor
Geforce GTX 770 video card

UPDATE TO REVIEW !!!!

13176273,76561197999597388,"Slightly disappointed, but good enough. Slightly disappointed because it's an inferior experience in comparison to Far Cry 3, and the main reasons for that are the plot and the characters.

As for the characters, there's only one worthy of note, and that's the main antagonist, whom the player doesn't interact with for most of the game. It reminds me of Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2, since he also contacts the player during gameplay with either goofy stories, or more rarely, some insight into some characters you meet. Other than that, the two main characters that will accompany the player in this journey are bland, and serve mainly to advance the plot. It's unlikely you'll care a whole lot for any of them. Interestingly enough, there are three other antagonists that stand at key turning points in the game who seemed way more interesting, but unfortunately disappear shortly after they're introduced. All in all, compared to the cast of friends and family from Far Cry 3's protagonist, plus Citra and Vaas, not to mention other side characters; Far Cry 4 feels like it lacks character.

About the plot, I have mixed feelings. I think it's original and inventive, in the way in intertwines in itself, but it only shines right at the end; and by the end, I mean the very last cutscenes. This plot doesn't provide the player with much motive to do what he's supposed to do, other than, ""it's a video-game about shooting things, so let's shoot things"". Again, contrast that with Far Cry 3, where the protagonist was given so much purpose. Between saving his friends and family, getting revenge and becoming a tribal hero (either by spiritual guidance or manipulation, depending on your take on Citra), there was plenty of motivation to go around. In this game, the protagonist comes simply to scatter his mother's ashes, when he's taken peacefully by a quirky king of the island, then leaves his palace while he's away, then joins a rebelion against him, seemingly just so that he can get to the place where he's supposed to scatter the ashes. Furthermore, the protagonist inexplicably has great skill at killing people with a knife and all sorts of firearms, plus, an uncanny ability to skin animals to craft better equipment for him. In Far Cry 3, this change was also appalling, but at least it attempted to justify the change. In this game, there's not even an attempt at justifying it.

About the game mechanics, there are a few things that bother me. The skill tree is underwhelming. It seems smaller than Far Cry 3's, and most of them are very bland. An exception to this is the skill to mount an elephant, of course. I'm not a fan of the locks on some skills and weapons, that forces the player to do specific side quests a number of times. I'd rather they were kept optional, and the difficulty in getting those items based on an increased number of skill points or money, respectively, so that the player can pick what he wants to do, from all the optional activities, to unlock what he wants to take. Also, the climbing of towers to reveal the map is back, which I think is something that worn out its welcome a long time ago. Again, keeping those as optional quests would be fine, but linking them to clearing the map makes them mandatory, and 1st person platforming doesn't get any more fun the more you do it.

The sandbox is, as always, fun, but it's crossing the line between being active and being annoying. Many more things happen as you travel around, not just in type, but in volume as well. For the most part, it's a good change. For instance, skirmishes between the two factions happen along the road much more frequently, and this time, the player actually gets rewarded by helping. The volume of these interruptions might be a little too over the top, though. Often it feels like the whole island is out to kill you, due unlikely chains of events that happen more than they should; like leaving an outpost only to have to go back to it seconds later because it's under attack, then leaving again only to be sidetracked by an event where you have to chase an enemy truck, only to be attacked by an eagle, then a leopard, then the bad guys show up, until you have to decide to just ignore the sandbox and do whatever you wanted to do in the first place.

Having said all that, I'd still recomend this game. It's core mechanics are mostly unchanged since Far Cry 3, but they're still a lot of fun. Liberating outposts and fortresses never gets old, especially with all the options that the player has to deal with them. The addition of grappling is very circumstantial, so I didn't care for it. The addition of a buzzer, on the other hand, was very welcome; you basically have a small helicopter to cut down on long travel times. The sandbox nature of the game really comes to light as unscripted, unexpected awesomeness happens all the time. The weapons are fun to use. The animal life had a definitive upgrade with elephants and rhinos. 

All in all, it's a solid game, but if faced with the choice between this and its predecessor, I'd recomend Far Cry 3 instead.",1417411382,1417411382,1,0.5,2873,2873,1417405983,"{""recommendationid"": ""13176273"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197999597388"", ""num_games_owned"": 581, ""num_reviews"": 62, ""playtime_forever"": 2873, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 2873, ""last_played"": 1417405983}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Slightly disappointed, but good enough.

13175335,76561197984851508,"I have been playing the custom made maps and the campaign more than the laggy bugged out multiplayer. I live in Alaska and my lat is 200 and up. No localized content not even one in Seattle or Portland to lower it under 200. So when I play online I have to aim in some funky spot other than where the player is to be able to get a kill. 

Pros
Graphics are impressive in ultra settings
Very low FPS drop
Campaign has me fully hooked so far
Controller support is solid

Cons
Can't play co-op till after act 1 is finished basically so that sucks
being connected with u-play sucks
Not being able to skip any cut scenes naturally sucks specially for the intro (atleast the multiplayer is a 1 time deal)
No real stealth mode for hunting, once you get within 100 feet they split and a badger, boar, wolf, pig, monkey should only take 1 shot from an AK-47. 
Some minor glitches - lags out in pagan min compound after going down stairs, glitches when you jump in the truck after escaping the compound (i was stuck sitting on the head rest of the seat, took 2 mins to get the truck to move after running to it, the gun wouldn't cycle till we were about to be slammed off the cliff.
it was a 3 cycle of that quest to get it to run right and smoothly.

In all I think the major fuck up is the multiplayer and the co-op other than that it is fun and entertaining. But I would like some free run similar to maybe what mordor is like, run where ever take over the tower open the quests. Why not, what if we want to explore the whole map before we run the missions, maybe we would like to unlock everything so we can choose what to do other than end the game of course. Or maybe like me hunt and build up my storage capacity without being reset back to the main mission area.

I LOVED Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon. LOVED em!

I mean...that'd be awesome if it was a world full of possiblities and I could do anything! But it's a world full of grinding and I couldn't figure out how to advance the game (even so I could grind efficiently with waypoints and belltowers in the North).

I was super shocked to find out this game was scored by Cliff Martinez of Drive and Only god forgives soundtracks!

A near perfect game for me. I think people dismissing this on the basis of it being Ubisoft alone are really missing out; If you are truly voting for your wallet, buy the good games, don't just ignore them all. If they can't win your dollar, they will never try to.

For those dismissing it on buginess, for the few remaining bugs, there are many fixes. Ubisoft was good about getting patches out immediately. For those dismissing it on the basis of being Far Cry 3.5, I feel this game has far more to offer both story and gameplay wise than 3 ever did. Far cry 3 feels like a demo by comparison.

I was satisfied with the way the story played out, and those who have an emotional, reactionary personality will find themselves stuck with a very bad ending. Pay attention, be rational, think, and you will get the best outcome this game has to offer.

I can't spoil the gameplay. It's goofy, over the top, action oriented, and beautiful. Performance has been fine. The characters are solid; even the ones I disliked I never wanted to be out of the game. I'm dissapointed you can't coop in the campaign missions, whatever though, the freeroam is great. If you miss the 4-player specialized coop campaign from Far cry 3. ehh, not my thing, I felt it was very derivative of other ""coop"" shooters.

This game is a complete rip off if you already played Far Cry 3, you'd basically be getting the same exact expierence just about with a few ""neat"" toys.

This game honestly has a low quality build and is really piss poor considering what we should be able to do in this gen of gaming, this is honestly more of a 2010 game. Just because it has fancy visuals and animation doesn't make it good in the least, the game honestly in the end is more of a 30$ game. Though I am having fun with it, that doesn't mean I'm gonna look at it from a fair logical view.

13166025,76561198090710667,"Summary of what I will go into detail about:
This is Far Cry 3 but improved it practically everyway possible.  Everything that made it good is back and better if it could be better.  Upgrade even more weapons, more paintable skins.  The Side Missions are plentiful and there is so much to see off the beaten path.  You will ultimately dictate how much fun you have in the game.


More Details:

Weapons:  The game has about the same setup for weapons.  You unlock 3 more slots but now your first unlockable weapon slot is a sidearm slot for pistols and smaller guns like a single shot grenade launcher.  There are a lot of weapons.  I don't have a precise # but I know it's like 30 or so and even more if you count the signature weapons. 

Animals/People: There are more animals in the wild and they are even more deadly than they were before.  Animals are a force to be afraid of early on but become more of a fun play thing to toy with once you unlock everything.  The enemies are plentiful as well and random fights happen more often.  They are also a bit more intelligent and aren't as simple as before to kill.  Of course when you unlock the North side of the map they get even harder and are a bit more of a challenge.  My suggestion is aim for the head and if your aim is true they will not stand a chance.

Story: 
It was rather interesting and entertaining.  It kept you wanting to learn more but this also conflicts with me wanting to unlock as much as I can and just play around.  Overall the basic idea of the game is pretty solid and works well.  Although I still have to wonder how another random man from the states is so deadly.

Side Missions:
This is a big one.  There are tons of types of side missions you can do.  There are a few race types which are fairly easy to get gold on without having to be really good at driving.  The other missions are either save hostages and you can't be spotted otherwise they execute them or assassination missions where you have to kill a commander and loot him and escape without being spotted.  You can also get a bonus for hiding his body before you leave.  Another type has you kill 2 commanders with a certain weapon type which allows you to use your own weapon of that type of you want which is a nice change of pace.  The hunting missions works the same way as well which I really liked.  There are a few more that I am not thinking of but they are all fairly entertaining.

Unlockables/Skills:
This game has a lot of guns and things that can be earned and unlocked.  You get XP as well as you kill enemies and you get more based on how they die.  Head shots earn more xp and Heavy Enemies(hard to kill especially early on) give quite a bit more.  You can also do karma events which are random events like save a hostage who is being taken out in the wilderness by 1 or 2 guys.  Pretty easy to do.  Help the rebels kill the Royal Army which is simple.  There are a few that are simple like this that give you a chance to earn extra karma xp outside of doing missions.  These levels you get here unlock more Guns for Hire Tokens and you can upgrade them which allows you to call in rebels to help you fight.  The guns you unlock by either picking them up or purchasing them.  Some guns you start with being able to be purchased while other unlock after a certain point into the main story.  By getting to the top of the Bell Towers  you can unlock some weapons without purchasing.  Signature weapons are unique though in that they are normal weapons but with specific attachments on them which cannot be changed but they are better than they would normally be.  Most of the regular weapons can be upgraded with scope/sight attachments, silencer or larger magazines.  They all also have different paints you can apply as well.

Upgrades and other things I missed:
You can upgrade your pouches and wallet by skinning animals and crafting them when you get a certain amount.  If you get a clean kill by using a bow and arrow or a auto-cross which uses bolts, you can get 2 hides per animal instead of just 1.  You have to be careful though since some weapons might damage the hides.  I suggest not using a Elephant gun to kill any small game if you want hides.  There are Molotovs, Grenades, Throwing Knifes and Bait which will attract wild beasts to the area to attach your enemies.

Co-Op/Multiplayer/Editor:
You are limited in distance from your partner and you can't do the main story with them as well.  Other than that though it is pretty awesome.  I have yet to try Multiplayer vs or anything so I can't really say how that is.  I also have not used or tried to use the Editor.

Far Cry 4 isn't so amazing as what the critics say. It is a very finished game and that's the problem. If this game was in early access I might be able to forgive it but it's not, so there is no excuse for a lack of content. There are a total of about 15 Guns in the game, not counting the Flamethrowers, 2 Rocketlaunchers, and the bow. You may think this is an okay amount and I'm being too hard but I don't think I'm being hard enough. The first two hand guns can be immediatly discounted as they do little to no damage against the enemy and the MP34 is a terrible weapon. You will almost no matter what end up using the AK-47, Scorpin, and RPG/Bow seeing as these are the most cheap and available weapons and do the most damage. Now people who play the game will say ""Oh what about the signatures"", well let me tell you about the signatures THEY ARE COMPLETE BULL! The game restricts you from putting attachments on the early guns so that you have to save up for the signatures to get say the first pistol with a silencer. It is a crappy way to stretch the content. Vehicles are extremely lame and traffic is non-existant. You'll see the odd enemy encounter, sure. But Civilians are extremely rare (I've almost completed the game and only seen two outside of the base and missions) and your allies are rarely there.

13152851,76561197972354196,"Fun game but not as good as I hoped.  I enjoyed Far Cry 3 quite a bit more.

The only thing I really alot that they added to this game that wasn't in 3 was the gyrocopter.  I have to admit I used it to unlock a lot of towers without having to climb to the top.  Maybe not what they intended but I found it very convenient towards my goal of unlocking all towers/outposts to get the best weapons.

I feel they added a lot more annoyances this time around that made the gameplay more annoying.

Eagles - They swoop in without warning and fly away out of sight.  Not fun at all!
Radio announcer - Guy sounds like a douchebag american and you can't turn just him off.  You can turn off the raidio station and the announcer but not just the announcer, which makes changing the radio station pointless.
Mortors - It's a lot harder to take out an outpost at long range because you get one shot from the mortors unless you have line of sight to kill everyone who tries to man the mortor.
Sneak/limited weapon missions - They have more missions that require you to sneak around and not be seen and/or only have a crappy weapon like a knife limiting your choice on how to play.

I felt it also took to long to unlock the quest ""A Key to the North"" which unlocks all your health bar skills, all outposts and towers.  Some signiture weapons are significantly better than other weapons and you can't get these until you unlock that mission.  I would have liked more options to be able to use those weapons sooner.

13136721,76561198036516971,"Very fun to play and beautiful to look at. It doesn't boast anything ""ground breaking"" like Destiny or Advance Warfare, it has built upon Farcry 3 and has more content and a different location. I really enjoyed Farcry 3 and this is a polished version of that, meaning all the improvements they've made I've greatly enjoyed. All the new features are great and easy to get adjusted to. I still wish they would allow you to skip cutscenes, but then again it forces me to get into the story. 

Some new features I really enjoyed:
-Being able to disable brakes outside the vehicle; place on a hill and watch em go.
-Grappling hook makes scaling mountain sides much faster so you can jump off em. The grappling system works surprisingly well, being able to swing around and ungrapple. It is very easy to learn and adapt to, but there are only certain grapple points which can be frustrating to find, especially if one entire mountain side doesn't have one.
-Throwing knives are awesome and satisfying
-The physics are the same from FC3, i.e., bullets shoot straight and gravity's hold on arrows is ever so slight
-There are a lot of cool little caves to explore that are fairly detailed and different, I spent a bit of time crashing into mountain sides trying to get near a cave.
-Vehicles have an auto-drive which is AMAZING. It allows you to actually shoot back at other vehicles and people rather than raining bullets into the air.
-The mini helicopter is awesome and gets you where you need to go and over those pesky mountains.
-Outposts are replayable. This is a great feature and gives you something to do after you beat the game. I've done so many varieties of outpost clearing because of this, throwing knives only, melee only, shotgun only, desert eagle only, grenades only, etc
-The location is amazing just to look at. Similar to Skyrim for it's vast appearance when you reach the top of a huge mountain or are just cruising with the auto-drive and able to see some great sights.
-Side missions are great and add a bit of variety and random diversions. 
-Map editor is pretty cool and people come up with some great maps. It isn't the hardest to use, but requires creativity and patience. Worth checking out.

Those are just a few of the new features I enjoyed, there are plenty more. All in all this game still brought a crazy amount of randomness and hilarity. My first hour playing I accidentally machete'd a civilian in the face who was getting attacked by an eagle; the eagle few away right as I was swinging. I felt terrible cause their husband watched me brutally kill them by accident. I saw three of my rebel buddies I just saved in a firefight get mowed down by a civilian speeding in a van.

The story tastes like cardboard, with a blank-slate protagonist with absolutely no character (as opposed to Brodie, from FC3, who had a wonderful character arc balancing simultaneously blossoming strength and psychopathy), and tone that jumps madly about between serious and silly (rather than managing to combine the two, as FC3 did). 
Hunting has been UTTERLY RUINED. You go to the spawn area for the animal, throw some bait, and literally 2 seconds later, the animal shows up to eat it, and you shoot it from the perfect safety of your vehicle mounted machine gun. No fun left in it at all.

Far cry 4's graphics are almost movie-like. With fantastic animations, great foliage and shadowing, the game looks simply brilliant. It has a nice Game look to it without it looking fake, unreal and Non-immersiable. while i have only played a miniscule amount of the game, i can already tell that it will take off to become on my top games. 

Gameplay, Far cry 4 started out fantastic. the characters are great, connectable, and you can really imagine the reality of them. Even the main antagonist is fantastic, honestely i would totally be on his side of things, and that would be a great twist. The talking amongst various NPC to NPC's is also not terrible. You don't necessarily hear, ""I used to be an adventurer like you, until i took an arrow to the knee"" a thousand times until it becomes hardy-har funny. It uses a fantastic amount of realism and is overall a very immerseful experience.

Hunting, the hunting in Far cry 4 is fantabulous. It's honestly. I can't get enough of it. It is too easy to be walking along see a deer and end up on the other end of the map wingsuiting down from a bridge following a river all the way down to a small lake that i can fish at, well more like unload on the water until stuff floats up. But, the point is that it's great.

Co-op.  The Co-op in far cry 4 is exactly what i hoped it would have been in far cry 3 only better. It has a fantastic selection of things to do and if you run out of things to do because you and a friend are simply too badass, then reset the outposts.! It's amazing how that can restore the fun back into the game and keep you coming back for more action packed hunting, killing, looting, driving, and exploration.

Even the main antagonist is fantastic, honestely i would totally be on his side of things, and that would be a great twist. The talking amongst various NPC to NPC's is also not terrible. You don't necessarily hear, \""I used to be an adventurer like you, until i took an arrow to the knee\"" a thousand times until it becomes hardy-har funny. It uses a fantastic amount of realism and is overall a very immerseful experience.\n\nHunting, the hunting in Far cry 4 is fantabulous. It's honestly. I can't get enough of it. It is too easy to be walking along see a deer and end up on the other end of the map wingsuiting down from a bridge following a river all the way down to a small lake that i can fish at, well more like unload on the water until stuff floats up. But, the point is that it's great.\n\nCo-op.  The Co-op in far cry 4 is exactly what i hoped it would have been in far cry 3 only better. It has a fantastic selection of things to do and if you run out of things to do because you and a friend are simply too badass, then reset the outposts.! It's amazing how that can restore the fun back into the game and keep you coming back for more action packed hunting, killing, looting, driving, and exploration. \n\nRate 9.5/10 - fantastic game. very well done.

13116070,76561198054971149,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I rum this on a higher end computer.

Now that I've covered that base, Far Cry 4 is  great (minus uplay, of course).

Good:
- The game is stunning and just so mesmerizing that I find myself caught up in the settings beauty and not actually playing the game
- Very similar to far cry 3 in many ways, which is mostly good because the game expands on many of the good points of its predecessor
-  Gyrocopter isn't incredibly op but suprisingly balanced
-Recurve Bow w/ reflex sight-so much fun- and other on lead free weapons grant double the skin when slaughter the magnificent and terrifying creatures of Kyrat. Which brings me to my next point...
- The magnificent and terrifying creatures of Kyrat. Getting attacked from all angles, honey badgers, HONEY F**KING BADGERS, eagles from the sky, and gods knows what else.
- Mortars in outpots make taking your sweet time on liberating an outpost more challenging which makes you a better player/bowman
-ELEPHANTS YOU CAN RIDE INTO BATTLE

Not so Good:
- The Karma system is a little weird times and is kind of annoying at times with the amount of karma events.
- The honey badgers don't care how many times you have shot them with a shotgun they do not want do die.
- skill tree is a little weird with the setup

Bad:
- Uplay startup/ Uplay in general
- generally easy decision on who to side with on choice missions (no spoilers here)
-Uplay

Downright offensive:
-Uplay

I'll go past the glitchy black bars, the flickering paper-thin trees, and the inability to remap the controls I've experienced so far in this buggy game.

After 4 hours of play, I have to ask myself, my character ""what am I doing here?,"" ""why am I being shot at?""

You come to an island to get rid of your mom's ashes, only to be almost-killed on numerous occasions. Then, it tuns out your now-dead mom knew that would happen all along, but without a warning she planned your visit. The supposedly-insane and wild villan treats you to a nice meal and a place to rest your head, but you don't get a chance to enjoy it as a gang of gun-slinging dudes come in to ""rescue"" you. 

After that point you are thrown into the broken world of annoying mountains and obstacles. Fighting for a goal you couldn't care less. 

What am I doing in this place? Why am I helping these people? Why am I risking my life for all of this?

There's no motivation for my character to be in this place. None at all. I'm just throwing myself into battles because the game wants me to. At one point I found myself being shot at by ""hunters,"" and I had absolutely no freakin' idea who they were or why they were trying to kill me.

All the basic elements of the genius Far Cry 3 are rehashed in this game: the towers, the outposts, the plants, and the animals. But there's no decent story, no motivation, no plot. You're just thrown into the place.

In Far Cry 3, right from the start, you were given no choice: you were forced to move on, to get stronger, to save those close to you because they were too big a part of who you are.

In Far Cry 4, you're meant to care about a dead woman you never knew, who supposedly knew you were going to meet danger but did not bother to warn you. You're meant to fight against a villan who loved your mom and who treated you nicely. It's just.... weak, dumb, and pointless.

I feel I can leave the world of Far Cry 4 at any second and nothing in my character's life would change; not for the worse at least, only for the better. Why should I care to scatter some random woman's (main character's mom) ashes in a warzone? Why should I care if some random guy (main characer's dad) was supposedly a badass at this place? Why does my characer constantly agree to risk his life to rescue a bunch of ""hostages"" simply because a random guy tells me to; while himself doing nothing for those hostages?

Just like Skyrim, Far Cry 4's positives are nothing by nostalgia whiffed off the previous iteration that ignore all the glaring bugs, plot holes, and lack of characterization.

I'm glad Far Cry 3  was great. It was amazing. It's the only justification I can give myself for spending $100 on the buggy, rushed, and barely-thought-through Far Cry 4.

All good things must come to an end, I guess. Far Cry 4 is the coffin of Far Cry 3.

[b]June, 2015 EDIT:[/b]
After waiting for critical bug fixes and buying a new, 16:9 monitor to fix the black bars issues, I've actually played and completed this game.

I suppose 60 hours of entertainment (and more, since I'll likely play it again in the future) justify the $100 I paid for the full super-duper edition. But it's an incredibly lazy re-hash of Far Cry 3 and it shows and that's what annoys me. It could've been an amazing Top-All-Time game if UbiSoft spent another year on it.

I've came across many bugs and glitches that look like problems swept under the rug by the devs/quality assurance team. The unlocks are incredibly unbalanced: you get a ton of unlocks at one time, then nothing for a long period. You get the best guns almost at the start of the game, so there's no point in getting any of the other ones. And the best and most fun gun to take out the outposts with is locked until you've completed 23 out 24 outposts. Ridiculous.

The writing is abhorrent. It serves no other purpose than to interrupt your pillaging of outposts. I didn't hate the villan: he was just a dictator, subjugating the people I didn't care about. I suppose it's bad, but should I do something about it? I didn't like the protagonists: they're obnoxious, ugly, and incessantly cry for help. Most of the missions you're told to do something while they all sit somewhere comfy. You're supposed to care for Kyrat because it's your birthplace, but you're constantly being told that you left when you were very young and you don't remember any of it. Should I care about a piece of land that was proximate to my mother's womb when I was born? Please!

The choices you make with the two supposed leaders of the Golden Path are non-choices. At one point I had to decide whether to side with Amita and keep the drug fields to make money to rebuild Kyrat or to side with Sabal and burn the field down because it's ""not who we are."" But that's a non-choice! I'm not given any alternative on how to rebuild Kyrat if we destroy the drugs. Amita says without the drugs we'll live in poverty and Sabal makes no counterargument! 

The details of the choices are moot, however, because they have absolutely no impact at the end.

Speaking of the end, what a load of manure it is! You can definitely find the various endings on YouTube, but the one I ended up with didn't even resolve the initial conflict. The very reason why my character decided to stay in Kyrat instead of legging it! I killed the bad gun with a boring shot to the head from a pistol during a cutscene and instantly it faded and I was shown ""FIN."" What about tea-bagging the guy? Good grief!

Lazy. Obnoxious. Pallid. An overpriced reskin of Far Cry 3, to be enjoyable by people who loved Far Cry 3.

It had an issue when released that made the game to crash when some USB controller was plugged. Now, fixed with patch 1.4.0.
Graphics are perfect. Characters movements are absolutely real, as well as face motion but, not only in main characters or just people, animals move as the real thing. Incredible!.

The world map is huge, variate and interesting enough.
Everything is alive and, random. You can be trying to get a post and then, several wild animals attack you; if you shoot them, you discover your position. ha ha ha. You should see how an eagle gets a goat or any other animal, how rinos charge against your car, etc. Awesome!.

Respect of FC3, a few more weapons, vehicles and, everything together was added.

There are some psicodelic missions and, some interesting new side quests or missions.
Missions on the snow and ice are specially good and, the escape from the prision is apotheosic (I've even seen the Yeti !!!).

The game delivers lots of playing hours and, scenarios are so good that it's funny to explore the whole map. High re-playability and, the possibility to play it in cooperative mode (campaign).
It has also some Multiplayer online game modes, which I didn't test so, I have no opinion, yet.

In the bad side, I could only say that to understand how to continue the main plot(s) takes a while and that, there are so many key assignments. IMHO, the interface could be reduced a lot to fewer keys, to make it easier to control your character  / vehicles / weapons.

Ok. Ubisoft failed delivering a game that hung if you had any USB device plugged (fixed with patch 1.4.0), what made angry to most of players, which were expecting the release date to death. This included myself, as well.
But, the amount of effort behind this game is colossal. Another great work from Ubisoft Montreal, a joy of game programming.

Gameplay: 8/10 (better than most)
Graphics: 10/10 (stunning)
Mechanics: 7/10 (best played with a controller... keyboarding a selection wheel is a bit awkward)
Music: 4/10 (annoying as hell unless you have a red dot on your forehead)
Co-Op: 7/10 (needs more but works pretty well with what it has currently)
Attacking killer eagles: -5/10  (fuq those eagles)

Long Review

So no surprise, FC4 is exactly like FC3... which is not at all a bad thing.  First of all, the game is gourgeous... long gone seem to be the days when beautiful cutscenes gave way to dismal graphics during the actual gameplay.  This game, to say the very least, is visually stunning. The new environment seems to work well (although you do have to suspend reality a few times-- crocodiles at high altitudes in the Himmalayns?)  Gamers with moderate PCs will be pleasantly surprised by medium graphics settings but of course, to truly take it all in, the highest settings are where it's at.

Gameplay is good, although its a bit buggy-- especially with the online co-op.  There seems to be a problem with syncing some of the casual encounters that the game offers such as taking out roving patrols and courriers between you and your co-op companion at times making these missions difficult, if not impossible to complete.  There are also issues with loading (especially after fast-traveling or completing a quest) in the SP mode where the game fails to load properly and you get a blank screen with sound.  Although this has happened a few times, it doesn't occur all that often and isn't anything that should keep you from buying the game.

So far, the biggest dissapointment of the game is the co-op mode which has fairly limited accessibility in terms of what you and your partner can actually do and the progress that can be saved.  Co-op mode only allows the joining party to save money, weapons, skins, etc... no quest progress is saved.  This means that aside from collecting new weapons and such, the joining partner will not really get all that much accomplished within their own campaign leading to a lot of play overs.  Additionally, there are many things available in SP that are no available in co-op.  The hosting party will not be able to complete any campaign missions while in co-op mode, and thus will be unable to advance the geography while in a co-op match.  This would lead one to conclude that co-op should be undertaken after one has already completed a good portion of the campaign and has unlocked many of the locales and side missions that can be undertaken together.  This is a little dissapointing compared with games like Borderlands which allow both parties to advance simultaneously.  Not sure why they didn't go in that direction but nonetheless, I'm happy to have the co-op in any form.

The biggest complaint I have about the game so far is the inability to replay things in co-op mode that would allow for a longer, more satisfying experience.  My co-op companion and I are obsessed with stealthing everything and were dissapointed that we were unable to replay fortress and outpost captures within the co-op mode.  That is something that I certainly feel needs changing.

Other than that, FC4 is an extremely solid game that rewards players for almost everything that you can do within it.   Hopefully in the coming months and expansions they expand the co-op mode a little and this game will get a lot closer to a perfect score.  For now, I plant this game at a solid 8.5/10.

    Gameplay
    The basic gameplay is very similar to Far Cry 3. You have campaign missions, side missions, liberate towers, and of course attack outposts. The biggest gameplay differences are throughout the main campaign you have two leaders arguing and you always need to be the decider. Second gameplay difference is now there are fortresses, which are a lot more fun too attack since they pose a little more difficulty. Third, the map being based in the hills has a lot more opportunities to make use of the grappling hook and the wing-suits. Finally the side missions are a lot more common and varied to keep it interesting even after you have finished the main campaign. I know I still have a ton of the map to explore. Overall the gameplay was familiar and I really enjoyed it but it didn't feel like an exact replica of Far Cry 3, they really improved the base model of gameplay

    Graphics
    I have a custom built hi-end PC and I was able to take full advantage of the high graphics quality. Everything from the characters to the terrain to the animals all looks so amazing and only a few games able to compare with that level. I know that for people with lower end computers it may not be as important, but for someone who can run it, the graphics are amazing. I understand many (too many) players have had issues with the game from black screens to frame stuttering, I have not had these issues since the launch day but I hope Ubisoft fixes them all for everyone's sake.

    Story
    While I was very skeptical of the story having to follow the amazing story brought to us in Far Cry 3. That being said the story is very well written. It has plenty of hooks and switches to keep you guessing from the start. One thing I will mention that there are several opportunities to shoot a person before they tell you their part of the story, I just wish that was a little more obvious so nobody misses any.

    Sounds
    As usual the background music for the whole story was amazing as well as all the sound effects. Everything fit very well together and made the game one step closer to perfection.

    My Closing Opinion
    I loved the game. I do feel that the story was unable to match Far Cry 3 but was still amazing. I love the vehicles and coop was a nice addition. I know I will still be playing this game every second of my free time for probably another month or two. I know I still have plenty of submissions and collectibles lying around to keep me entertained for a while.

13097446,76561197971509759,"The storyline is much worst then the one from the 3rd. 
In Far Cry 3 you feel the character progression as he turns from a rich brat afraid of real problems, to a true ""tattau"" wearing warrior. In this one, your a guy with a urn of your mothers ashes, that somehow you can carry them with you at all times in your pants (that's where he takes it from when he wants to look at them), and suddently you are in a forein place and you don't really seem to mind killing all these people, and you also suddently know how to use all types of weapons.

I'm 2 missions close to finishing the main quest, and still don't see any repercussions for the choices I made. I feel like it's going to be like Mass Effect 3 all over again - so much tough decisions for a meaningless ending. I'm taking this time to finish every bit of the game, but at this point it's just a repetition. I have captured all the enemy bases (except 1 fortress), done all the major side quests, all the radio towers, all the fashion week quests and loads of spinny totem things and propaganda - still I'm at 50% of the game. If 100% means stepping in every square meter of the map, picking all treasure chests and all the stuff, either I'm going to leave the game at 60% or something or I'm going to be bored to death.

All and all, this past 26.2 hours of gaming have been fun - some quests are repetitive (like the ones from the priest, always catching diamonds the same exact way), but still a positive experience. The only thing I'm ""mad"" about is that I feel as they have been lazy, so much potential in this game and they kind of rushed through it and just looped a bunch of things! But I still recommend this game. 

If you do buy this - you will have at least 25h of fun. Explore stuff, enjoy small things like watching an entire army be crumbled by an array of random events like rhino attacks, or troll a flamethrower enemy that cant never reach you from your helicopter but wont stop trying until he inevitably kills himself by accident.

13096771,76561197997968152,"I absolutely loved Far Cry 3. I beat the singleplayer, the coop campaign with 3 buddies, and hit max level in multiplayer. You can see my Far Cry 3 pvp videos on youtube, including ""Rambo Mode"", named by PCGamesN as one of the top 10 entertaining FC3 videos. Based on my love for Far Cry 3 I went ahead, on blind faith, and preordered the deluxe edition of this game.

With that said, what a massive disappointment this game is. There isn't any one single aspect that breaks it for me. Instead, I would call it death by a thousand cuts.

First off I want to address the absolutely undebatable. Something that has nothing to do with personal taste. This game is BUGGY AS ALL HELL. Several times I've randomly slid backwards up hills as if an invisible force was dragging me backward. I've died from 5 foot drops, and in the next moment fell 30 feet and didn't take a single point of damage. Birds constantly land in midair. I've seen up to 4 birds all perched in the sky, and it's not due to draw distance -- this happens even a few meters away on ultra detail. If you skin an animal and your inventory is full, that animal is forever broken and cannot be skinned, even if you drop items to free up space. To add insult, they still glow white as if lootable. Small bugs like this are absolutely pervasive, and affect nearly every mechanic in the game.

Looking past the bugs, this game is also riddled with poor design decisions. Perhaps the most outrageous and baffling is that there is a constant tiny radius around you during every single mission where if you walk 10 feet out of it, you lose. I thought this was an open world game? An early game example is when you have to pick between two quest givers and there is a propaganda poster less than 50 feet away from them. But you can't pick it up. If you do, you'll fail the mission for being out of bounds, and you'll have to watch the entire mission intro cutscene again which is several minutes long. You might say ""well, damn! That's not a big deal! I'll just turn around if the message pops up!"" Good luck. All the most fun ways to travel (wingsuit, gyrocopter, handglider, etc) move so fast that you'll get game over'd a split second after you see the message. This game is an open world game that arbitrarily decides it doesn't want to be open world anymore. It wasn't such an issue in Far Cry 3 because a) it was far more rare, b) the boundaries were far less confined, and c) there were clear out-of-bounds lines shown on the map when this type of rule applied. Not here.

In coop, we experienced falling through the world. Respawning and instantly dying as if falling from a great height. Terrible syncing issues, such as seeing whole groups of enemies and vehicles that my coop partner did not. This was not a consistent issue, but it's something we never experienced in all of our hours playing Far Cry 3. The most ridiculous death I had was getting teleported to my buddy because he had wingsuited off a cliff. It teleported me close to him in mid-air, in my own wing suit, headed straight toward a cliff wall and I promptly died.

The PVP is so bad now I'm not even going to waste words on it.

A lot of people complained about Far Cry 3's story, but this story is just flat and lifeless. Pagan Min seems entertaining enough, but your character's motivation -- what we're supposed to relate to -- is meaningless. You're here to spread your mother's ashes -- so logically you might as well stay and instantly transform into a super soldier. Criticise Far Cry 3's Jason Brody all you want, but at least he had an easily relatable motivation -- revenge, and a modicum of development. He changed, however unlikely, from a terrified kid into a guerilla leader. In this, your character literally goes from being a bored sounding tourist with no desire to be involved in the war, to hanging up on the rebel leader offering you backup and telling her you are going to destroy the very first enemy outpost in the game by yourself. Why? ""Because I can handle this."" And your character still sounds incredibly bored about it all. I can't stress how bored your character sounds at every moment of the game.

I am scratching my head trying to understand how they could take a solid game like Far Cry 3 and break so many aspects of it. The grappling is cool. Some of the new wildlife is cool. The graphics are gorgeous. But everything else? I'm just not happy with my purchase at all.

13086257,76561198075713966,"People who say that this game is extremely similar to Far Cry 3 in both concept and design, are right. However, this doesn't necessarily make it a bad game, and with all of its improvements that it has done to it, its similarities actually make it a way better game than Far Cry 3 ever was. I loved Far Cry 3, don't get me wrong, but it had its crappy moments, like bad guys all miraculously disappearing when you take out an outpost, or having weapon types. However, Far Cry 4 took all of this, and expanded on it, like adding in karma events, similar to random events from GTA V, which adds a little randomness to the overall gameplay, a much needed improvement from the dull post-campaign world of Far Cry 3. Weapons like the recurve bow, also feel like they have been significantly buffed, but not in a cheap way, making it almost like a medium-range sniper rifle. The new hunter enemy is also a cool addition, because unlike previous enemy types, he isn't a bullet cushion that shoots a cloud of bullets or fire at you, he actually hides from you, and even ambushes you in a style that hasn't been seen before in Far Cry. In a game where it feels like the enemies are borderline mentally disabled, it feels good to have an actual AI capable of coordinating a stealth attack consisting of several bow-wielding foes, as well as ""charmed"" animals that will fight for the hunters. Bad things for the game are few, but I personally felt the story wasn't as engaging as the story in Far Cry 3 was, but that's my opinion. Also, I experienced a glitch midway through the game that forced me to restart my entire game, which involved a blackscreen at a crucial point in the story, which I exited, and resulted in my being stuck in the overworld with no weapons forever, prompting me to restart. 

 In summary, is Far Cry 4 a clone of Far Cry 3 like everyone says? For the most part, yes, but the vast improvements made on it from Far Cry 3 make it pretty much an evolved version of said game, and I have absolutely no problem with that. Far Cry 4 is an awesome experience using the best that the Far Cry team could provide, and it shows. Although the campaign was lacking from the previous game, the gameplay and new implemented elements make up for this. I definitley recommend this game, especially since it looks like all of the updates to clear out game-wrecking glitches are finally out there.

13082592,76561197995070040,"OK review time.

I've played about 6 hours fo far. The game is definitely good; no doubt about that. I recommend it.

First is gameplay. It is indeed a lot like Far Cry 3. Most of the animations (if not all) are identical. Like they couldn't be bothered to change them? It feels like I'm playing an expansion than a new game. That's not necessarily a bad thing. CoD does that every year and nobody panics. But then Far Cry does it everyone looses their minds.
The gameplay is typical Far Cry. Open world, with radio towers outposts and side missions. The crafting is almost identical too. You hunt animals and you get their pelts to craft stuff (like more weapon slots) or sell them for money. The weapon system is also identical. You get 4 slots but you have to craft them and so far one of them is for sidearms only (I've only unlocked 2 so far).

Next is the main character and story. I've read other reviews and they all said that he's boring. In my opinion he's similar to the character from FC3 but without the tattoos. Just a guy that has been put at a situation he doesn't want to be in. He's in Kyrat to bury his mother's ashes in the middle of a civil war (or a rebellion) and he decides to help them a little bit in thanks for saving his life. And that's all I know about it. Too early to say if it's good but so far it looks like the typical help-the-rebels-against-the-oppressing-ruler kind. 

Last is the graphics. On my system (i5 3470 @ 3.2Ghz, 4GB ram, Sapphire 7850 OC 2GB, Windows 8.1, and Samsung 840 ssd though the game isn't installed on that) the game runs great. At very high (but not ultra) and without Anti-aliasing and Ambient occlusion it runs at 40-60 with vsync enabled. And here comes the elephant in the room. They say stuff about black screens and bad optimization and crashes but I've had none of that. On the other hand I have had stutters. Every couple of minutes or so framerate drops at 10-15 for a couple of seconds. It is indeed annoying but I can deal with that. After the horrendous bullcrap some call video game and other Assassin's Creed, Far Cry 4 this is actually pretty good.

I haven't tried multiplayer yet and I probably never will so I can't say anything about that.

If I had to rate it it would be 7/10. Despite it's fun gameplay, the story is mediocre, it stutters a bit and it feels like I bought Far Cry 3 by accident.

It also needs uplay. Of course it needs uplay. Stupid thing I hate it. I nearly rated it 6/10 for this bullcrap.

And one last thing. It doesn't have support for 16:10 resolution screens (or anything else other than a 16:9). It just covers the top and bottom of the screen with two black bars in order to maintain the 16:9 ration without stretching the game. What is this bullcrap?

I also bought this with the first day DLC, and that's on me, but it's certainly not worth $20 for a few guns and missions when the game as a whole suffers. Wait until Ziggy or someone else drops a mod for this game and then play it. Hopefully in a few months the stability and Uplay integration will be sorted out.

Dry story. Lame gun limitations. Ubisoft--a swing and a miss.

Oh, your looking for a review tho? Well not much can be said really that other people haven't said already, it's pretty much feels, looks, plays and acts like Farcry 3. Sometimes it feels kind of like a huge map and storyline DLC and gets abit boring, but when you realize how huge the open world is in this game you change your mind rather quickly, and the few differant add features and things here and there really help as well.

The quick answear is if you loved the hell out of Farcry 3 and you want some more, you'll love this, if not, then wait until this goes down in price becuase it's not a whole new game, its the same old with added stuff which is what gamers mostly expect from sequals anyway now days, Ubisoft went down the easy and safe road and it's fine. Personally im hooked and loving it, I love the open world, popping piles of douche bags and collecting eff tons of goodies all over the place and feeling like im progressing and taking over the world for the greater good.

13075397,76561198043711944,"MY PC REVIEW OF FAR CRY 4.

 Hello PC Farcry 4 customers.  As a group what can we do as consumers,  In any part of the World when purchase something exchange cash for a product or service as a mutual benefit.  We did not get what we paid for and were not advised that this may or may not be a issue before we gave UBI our hard earned money.  They UBI internally were well aware of the issue before they launched the game, but decided to launch it to increase their revenue for their fiscal 3rd quarter to impress their share holders rather than impress their customers that bought the game..... Today they are definitely well aware of this problem but there are NO ADVISEMENTS ON STEAM ABOUT IT.  WHAT I AM TRYING TO CONVEY IS THAT THEY ARE STILL COLLECTING THE $59.00 FROM PEOPLE WHEN THEY KNOW THE GAME WILL NOT WORK. THEY COMMITTING A HUGE FRAUD TAKING OUT MONEY AND GIVING US NOTHING IN RETURN...   NOW THAT IS DIRTY....  Best Analogy... you stand in line at Starbucks to get your coffee and when you place your order they take your money knowing that the machine does not work.  All sales final, so their solution is we will give you a e-mail when the machine is fixed, but we do not know when it will be, ""THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENTS"" WTF...Internet Fraud

A crime in which the perpetrator develops a scheme using one or more elements of the Internet to deprive a person of property or any interest, estate, or right by a false representationof a matter of fact, whether by providing misleading information or by concealment of information.

As increasing numbers of businesses and consumers rely on the Internet and other forms of electronic communication to conduct transactions; illegal activity using the very samemedia is similarly on the rise. Fraudulent schemes conducted via the Internet are generally difficult to trace and prosecute, and they cost individuals and businesses millions of dollarseach year.

I told my friends NOT to buy the game because I thought it was just Far Cry 3 but with a few updates and the developers didn't spend enough time on it.
However, after a good 15 hours of playing the game, looking more closely on the construction of it and getting further and further into the storyline and side missions, I started to like it more and more. The animations are actually pretty good, and the textures on people like their skin, eyes and clothes are AMAZING. I think the developers definately could've spent more time on the graphics and textures though, the textures on some of the grass and the healing animations are terrible, yes - coming from the perspective of someone who thumbs'd up the game. A lot of people (including me, obviously) said that the game is ""like Far Cry 3 but with a 4"" and if you think about it, how bad can that be? Far Cry 3 was such a good game.

5.1, 7.1 surround didnt work for me and led to alot of problems with sound much like watch dogs. Some people have tried reinstalling 2010 Dx run time to solve it.  Here is a link http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109

At 4k this game looks amazing and using Nvidia MFAA options from the Nvidia control panel I get great fram rate improvement at lower resolutions. 

This game suffers from stuttering and texture pop in, I have heard it is from the mip maps, I only experience it when moving fast from one area to the next (I.E. wingsuit of a mountain)

Gameplay loop is very similar to Far Cry 3 but with more side missions and random events to keep you constantly near some sort of action. The weapons are solid although not varied and I found myself stealthing much more than I did in 3 at higher difficulties.

The wildlife in this game is aggressive and seemingly teleport near you at all times. You can be sneaking into a base to mark targets when suddenly a tiger, rhino,  and honey badger attack you, so you run only to be attacked by an eagle.  This happens without fail way to often often. This caused me to make a plan B for every plan A I have and in the end I enjoyed that.

The main antagonist Pagan Min is absent far to much for my liking (Troy Baker's performance is extremly likable in an insane dictator kind of way) He frequently calls post campaign missions to brief you on how crazy he is and such but little face to face time early on.

Much of Co-op is locked behind campaign missions so playing with a friend through the entire game is not possible, but it is some of the most fun I have ever had at high difficulty levels. Stealthy hunter infiltrates while overwatch spots and terminates. Its so satisfying it hurts. Sniping a guy and having your partner hide the body is a tactic I can use and a fun one.

The over all story line is passable if not plausible and many characters have a duality to thier decisions that can make you go either way with your choices in game. The intro is bad it makes a huge leap int othe action of you being a hero that is just jarring. Once you accept it though the game rolls forward at a nice pace and is wholly entertaining for the duratin of the ride. I recomend you try it for your self.

13060838,76561197973284373,"What makes this game good isn't it's single player, which is basically Farcry 3 +1.  It could do a lot to improve the game, but instead it only adds a thin layer on top of it.  Some of the characters around you are funny, and it seems to be a bit better at creating characters I find interesting, rather then being surrounded by mopy emo people... for the most part.  It trys a little too hard though sometimes and instead delivers more hollywood characters then people I'd believe to be in a setting.  It might be a little too critical.  Also it has half the map locked away until you progress through half of the quests.

People also say the wild life is really super duper hard, and the bases are punishing, but they never really seemed like much of a challenge to me.  Bow + arrow + range & highground = undetected win on compounds (even the strongholds,) and the wildlife seem to just have more HP.  The rhinos are a bit hard and take a lot of punishment when you first go up against them, but after you realize how the AI works and how you can work around their attacks they become just as easy as everything else.  

Now to the fun stuff.  It's a hell of a lot of fun doing co-op with another friend.  I was laughing almost the whole time as we did silly fun things.  It's the kind of co-op Farcry 3 should have had.  Take the map, take all the sub quests (not the main ones sadly) and have at with a friend.  It's a hell of a lot of fun.  What would make it better?  If the game basically did what diablo 2 did when adding another person into the mix.  Make more enemies spawn or make them harder, because in the end having a second player just makes opening up the map, or taking out outposts/strongholds easier.

However the fun isn't in the challenge it's in doing dumb stuff, and crashing in weird ways and killing both of you by maybe panicking and firing a rocket launcher at your feet.  It also opens up more dialogue from a character called Hurk, who is the character the person joining into the game will be.  Who is like the main character, but funny, has really great lines, and...... well..... really would have been more fun if he was the main character instead of the bumbling, want to help, coy Rambo mic kill everything.  Which is weird because why would Rambo be coy?

The single player campaign is nothing to write home about.  It's basically Farcry 3, and there is some nudity in the game but it doesn't really add much to the game other then ""and then there were more painted boobies... and a very very very brief shot of your characters crotch,"" as opposed to when Farcry 3 used it to make a powerful statement.  So basically just expect more Farcry 3.  Yet when I played it with a friend and laughed for hours, and hours.

What does the game need?  In co-op I'd love it if I could just explore the whole entirety of everything on the games map instead of being restricted to half of the playing field because I didn't progress through the whole story.  Then allow me to reset the map so we can take those outposts all over again.  Also when outposts get attacked and I just walk away?

It could do a lot to improve the game, but instead it only adds a thin layer on top of it.  Some of the characters around you are funny, and it seems to be a bit better at creating characters I find interesting, rather then being surrounded by mopy emo people... for the most part.  It trys a little too hard though sometimes and instead delivers more hollywood characters then people I'd believe to be in a setting.  It might be a little too critical.  Also it has half the map locked away until you progress through half of the quests.\n\nPeople also say the wild life is really super duper hard, and the bases are punishing, but they never really seemed like much of a challenge to me.  Bow + arrow + range & highground = undetected win on compounds (even the strongholds,) and the wildlife seem to just have more HP.  The rhinos are a bit hard and take a lot of punishment when you first go up against them, but after you realize how the AI works and how you can work around their attacks they become just as easy as everything else.  \n\nNow to the fun stuff.  It's a hell of a lot of fun doing co-op with another friend.  I was laughing almost the whole time as we did silly fun things.  It's the kind of co-op Farcry 3 should have had.  Take the map, take all the sub quests (not the main ones sadly) and have at with a friend.  It's a hell of a lot of fun.  What would make it better?  If the game basically did what diablo 2 did when adding another person into the mix.  Make more enemies spawn or make them harder, because in the end having a second player just makes opening up the map, or taking out outposts/strongholds easier.\n\nHowever the fun isn't in the challenge it's in doing dumb stuff, and crashing in weird ways and killing both of you by maybe panicking and firing a rocket launcher at your feet.  It also opens up more dialogue from a character called Hurk, who is the character the person joining into the game will be.  Who is like the main character, but funny, has really great lines, and...... well..... really would have been more fun if he was the main character instead of the bumbling, want to help, coy Rambo mic kill everything.  Which is weird because why would Rambo be coy?\n\nThe single player campaign is nothing to write home about.  It's basically Farcry 3, and there is some nudity in the game but it doesn't really add much to the game other then \""and then there were more painted boobies... and a very very very brief shot of your characters crotch,\"" as opposed to when Farcry 3 used it to make a powerful statement.  So basically just expect more Farcry 3.  Yet when I played it with a friend and laughed for hours, and hours.\n\nWhat does the game need?  In co-op I'd love it if I could just explore the whole entirety of everything on the games map instead of being restricted to half of the playing field because I didn't progress through the whole story.  Then allow me to reset the map so we can take those outposts all over again.  Also when outposts get attacked and I just walk away?  I should probably have to retake them instead of nothing happening which takes away from the tension of the event.  Maybe I don't want to save the outpost?  Maybe I want to go and bow the crap out of the guards who retook it?  Ever think of that Farcry4?  Anyways it's a solid game and I'd say play away.

Firstly, I'm not experiencing black screens, which I know many are, but I still find that this game is unplayable, so even if they do fix the black screens, the people that are experiencing them won't be very happy once they do. Secondly, considering how hard this game seems to drive, you would expect it to have the best graphics on Earth, you would however be wrong. This game looks absolutely miserable, the light reflects off of nothing and just appears wherever it feels necessary, the people are blurry if you stand 5 feet away from them and have massive ugly blue outlines, and the textures are blurry, flickery, and stretched.

I am running sli 780's, 1,000 fucking dollars of graphics cards, and can't even maintain 60 frames when in a village, seriously? Are you fucking kidding me? The reccomended is a 680, last gen card, now 2 gens old, and two cards that are above it can't even run it properly. When I am not in the villages, I can push 60+ very easily, however, this comes with one major drawback, the drawback being the constant flickering, dips, and stuttering. 

Another problem I encountered, on top of the game looking awful, was the fact that If I just so happen to hit escape to do anything, whether it be to change graphics or audio, the game will leave a frozen image of what I last saw on my screen with a lower opacity. So say that I was looking at an elephant and then hit esc, then I returned to the game and looked at a mountain, the picture of the elephant would still be there, just more transparent. The only way to fix this is to  restart the game and pray to god that you never end up hitting esc.

Finally, the gameplay and level design. Your character feels heavy and held back. He's almost difficult to control and attempting to aim and shoot is nearly impossible. It feels like a cheap knock off of Farcry 3. The level design is much more linear due to the fact that you can't climb whatever mountain you want, and all the cool things are just distant static images. This game could honestly be the next Five Nights at Freddies, you know, you bring your friends over and have them play it for a few minutes, and then they want to kill themselves, the only difference being that FNAF, was actually trying to accomplish this.

13050415,76561198078588311,"So Far Cry 4... My short answer is sure its worth the money (for me) but is it worth it for you?


Storyline: So obviously the storyline is no where as good as Far Cry 3s, but that does not mean its bad. Throughtout the story your fighting with the Golden Path with the two real annoying leaders who never can agree on shit. I wish the story had a little more meaning to fight for rather then, I need to kill all these people so I can spread my Mother's ashes. I find myself enjoying myself more when I am just exploring then actually doing the Main Quest. Also to note there is some copy and paste missions from far cry 3. However still a pretty good Story, not Far Cry 3 status but still better then any Call of Duty. I do wish that you heard more from the main antagonist Pagan more often as he just disappears intill almost the end of the story.

Side Missions: In Far Cry 4 there is a ton of side missions to do, lighting your map up. Some of the side missions get real tedious after a while, but they give good money and karma so its worth it. With all these missions you will be busy for hours after you complete the main quest.

Graphics: The graphics in the game are real amazing... Well when your standing still atleast. When just walking arounrd the graphic look stunning with himalayas in the background. The second you get yourself into a car or start wingsuiting the graphics become a blur and you begin to see the real flaws with in the graphics. That is still an issue in Far Cry 3, but thinking out of a Far Cry setting it seems a bit annoying. Most (almost all) textures in the game are amazing looking for being an open world. However there are some ugly looking textures when it comes to the rocks and the water. But in all still a jaw dropping experience.

Audio: The audio in the game is by far the best I have heard in any game. When running through the forests of Kyrat I feel like I am in the world, hearing all the sounds of nature ( deers, monkeys, elephants, etc). The sound track is done so nice, with all the ambient sounds and entertaining mixes to listen to. Speaking of mixes however I did found the Radio station a bit annoying at times. When you constantly hear the radio talk host Rabi Ray Rana repeat the same damn things over and over again. Which I know it would take forever to make enough dialogues to not hear repeats but when Playing GTA V I dont hear them repeat as often. My last and only gripe with the Audio is that you never get to really hear the protagonist Ajay Ghale. As he only speaks a couple of words at a time.

New Features: The game has done a real good job at making it feel fresh without making the game loose its purpose. The saying, ""Don't fix something that's not broken"" is present in Far Cry 4, at the base, but they have added some many new things to the Far Cry series that its amazing. Some features that they have added that are worth noting are; being able to throw meats to get animals attention, the ability to throw knifes, being able to purchase the wingsuit instead of waitin half way through the game to obtain, gyrocopters, hovercrafts, being able to call in backup, a refined map editor, actual good co op, and a pleather of new vechicles to choose from along with some old favorites from Far Cry 3. There is of course a lot of other features but those are just the ones worth mentioning.

A.I.: I feel they did a good job at A.I this time around, the bots are noticably harder and smarter compared to Far Cry 3, but it makes it more enjoyable and satisfying when you get a kill. The animals on the other hand is kind of a mixed bag. They do do a good job at being animals I guess, but they always seem to come and attack at the worst times, like that its in the code for them to just fuck you other when you're already in shit. Overall A.I. is pretty good.

Problems worth to Note: There are some issues in the game that I will note now; bad optimization (I feel it is no where as good as far cry 3s optimization), steam overlay does not want to work (for me atleast), cutscenes are unskipable, you have to wait through a long boring slide of things when you launch the game up everytime. Money in the game is way to easy to obtain and that I see myself always waisting money on things so my wallet isn't full. And lastly that it uses uPlay.

Conclusion: In conclusion it diffently has its spot in your library if your new to the Far Cry series or if your a veteran. At this very time I give the game a 7.5/10. If ubisoft come through and change most of the problems (being) textures, cut scenes. and optimization then heck I would change my rating to 9/10. However at the end of the day it is your choice to make the decession to buy not me. Happy Gaming.

Before I even got to play I was annoyed at the long cut scenes.  I paid for the game already, why does Ubisoft insist on forcing me to watch long, obnoxious scenes?

Once I actually got to start playing I noticed mouse lag - some of the worst I've ever experienced.  A combination of config file fixes found online and turning down the graphics quality got me past that.

Next came the dark shadows.  Anything covered by a shadow was black - I couldn't see anything.  After spending hours testing every video setting imaginable, I finally figured out it was SLI (I'm running a GTX 690).  I found another fix (hack) using NVIDIA inspector and SLI compatibility bits.  

Next was flickering.  If you use SMAA anti-aliasing things flicker everywhere.  Ultimately to get decent performance and visual quality I've turned off AA all together.  Even still I occasionally see flickering shadows.

Much like Far Cry 3, this game can't seem to figure out what I'm pointing at.  Sometimes I have to re-position myself several times to search a dead enemy or skin an animal.

Co-op comments

The jump in and out co-op is a lot more limited than I thought in that your basically limited to helping the host complete their quests and not making progress on your own.  You get to keep Exp, mana, crafted gear and loot.  You do not get to keep any quest progress or found quest items such as masks, lost letters etc . .  

Overall I find the spawn rates, the deadly wildlife and the lack of co-op features I was hoping for drag this game down to being a pretty remake of Far Cry 3, which is not all together a bad thing.

But this is my review of the game, The good and the Bad, and this is opinion based so don't hate because I have an opinion. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





Good:
Seeing the trailers before the game released got me excited for the game, especially knowing that there was going to be New progragonist, Location, Quest, Vehicles, Etc... Etc.... But what peaked my eye the most was the new Antagonist. We already seen Pagian Min back at E3 2013 and he looked like a promising new character, and looked fresh, like an original character that Ubisoft created. But besides that there were also going to be 3 other Antagonist: Noore, Paul, & Yuma. Each Antagonist is placed in a different area in the map so you dont have to see them in the same location, which gives you time to explore the map. Besides that Ubisoft also added new ways on how you can play the game, They have given you weapons such as the Auto-crossbow if you want to stealth, MG42 if you want to go loud, or bait if you want the animals to do the work. The minute I moved around i saw a beautiful atmosphere, and lots to do: Minigames, Outpost capture, or just helping fellow villagers restore what has been lost. What ubisoft added that i enjoyed was a Autodrive feature, so when you're a lazy and dont feel like pressing the ""W"" key to your location, all you have to do is press shift and you're on your way to the location, and if you're are under-attack while you're in the car, you dont have to get out of the car to kill the people and get back in, you can just turn yor screen to where the enemy is and fire. Like any Dark story, there always has to be a Comic Relief in the game to turn away from the dark Narrative story, They introduced Yogi And Reggi to Take you out of the dark world and Introduce you into a world with bright vivid colors, after they inject you with fluid, after you smoked their dank (weed). Hurk being Hurk wants to blow up stuff with his funny accent and is new to the country of kyrat. Find you to blow up stuff. What i liked what they added which few games have is a survival mode to test your skills which is the arena. The Arena adds waves of enemies that come after you, and what i like about it is they added an Endless survival mode, where you continue to play it until you die. and i do enjoy endless survival mode games, such as Zombies from Call of duty, Survival From modern warfare, I havent played it yet, looking for another partner to play it with me. 

Bad:
Getting in depth with the game, the moment I got this game there was so much optimization problems, and the thing that bugged me the most was you couldn't pause or go to the pause screen during a cutscene, you're forced to watch the sequence until it's over. The characters in the game Have a short time being on screen, you rarely see them and once you get attached to them. Plus the story was kinda Ronchy, The Story had Cliche's, Blood kill, oh well bye. Rememeber how you could craft special arrows in the game, well, you're forced to now buy them, so if you're in the middle of the fight and you dont have special arrows and want to craft them, too-freaking-bad, He doesn't have the Jason Brody experience where you're allow to craft Explosive/Fire Arrows. Another thing that bugged me is the skill tree, Far cry 4 Tried to go easier on the Skill tree, but if you want to heal but dont have a syringe kit, you'll only heal 1 bar, but if you want to heal faster than you have to do more quest for the ability, or if you want to take out 2 people again, you have to do a quest. This game took me only 5 days to beat, The game is extremely short compared to Far cry 3, To summarize the time length of Far cry 4 and Far cry 3, If i got to the ending of Far cry 4, I would've already met hoyt in Far cry 3 during the burning cage scene. The map itself when you meet the characters it's only half the map where it's story based, the other half is for you to explore, I wanted to go see the other half of the map during story but i guess it's part of the game. When you're automatically put in a quest and you want to loot dead bodies or chest, you cant leave the area or it will autofail you. The quick-time events in the game were extremely fast and you couldn't tell if they were coming or not. The supporting characters in the game. It was nice to see alot of screen time for Amita and Sabal, but when it came to Hurk, or Agent Willis, they had so little missions for you to play, and then they leave you, I do like the idea that they made an appearence back into far cry 4, but i wanted supporting characters to atleast stay in the game for 5 or 6 missions more to help me with tips and tricks on the country of Kyrat. But i guess the developers want to focus their attentions on the antagonist and the game itself. And finally for my Final rant before i Rate this game Are the animals in the game, They sneak up and they kill you out of nowhere, I mean it's a nice touch to the game where they wanted to make the game look real, but when it comes to when you're capturing an outpost or fortress: Tigers, and bears will give away your positions in the game and you will be caught with the sirens calling in for reinforcements.

Overall I do like this game so i will rate this out of 10

Score: 8/10

Is it worth 60 Dollars: Yes if you like a new location, Weapons, Side Quest, No if it's for the story

Reason: Yes - If you wanted change in a Far cry game, this is the way to go, They added numorous amounts of weapons, More ways to play the game, New vehicles, and Characters

No - If you expect a long story, Don't hold your breath, The story is way too short and The people you're attached to, They have short On Screen time before they off themselves.

This game is riddled with bugs---as of this writing 12/10/2014, my game has been unplayable and broken since 11/24/2014. Ubisoft tells me they're ""working on it"" and they've taken my game save file to analyze. My particular problem is that everything is bugged--skill points, crafting, money--nothing works.

I did spend a few hours playing before my game stopped working and I found numerous disappointments within the game. First off, if you played Far Cry 3, note that co-op here is not mission based like that was; in this game all co-op is open world. Not nearly as enjoyable, and the worst part is that only the game host unlocks all of the towers along the way. If you're the invitee, when you get back to your single player game, you have to do it all over again to unlock for yourself.

Additionally, the missions are repetitive and the tower unlocks to open the map gets tiresome very very quickly. We were extremely disappointed in the co-op in this game, and for that alone, I recommend you give it a pass. Even if my game worked properly, I wouldn't pay more than $14.99 for what essentially feels like a DLC to Far Cry 3.

As for the controls. They're a little sketchy. I do not recommend using a game pad because there's virtually no aim assist. You will miss constantly. Mouse for the win. 

As for the SEASON PASS. I Paid 90 bucks for nothing. Literally I have nothing extra that other's do not for the 60 dollar version. I don't know if this is a bug or something but I see no extra missions or benefits for season pass... Don't even bother.

PvP Multiplayer. More like. Sit in the bell tower and let the enemy team win. Also, why is there no voice chat? There is no communication possible in your team. You have an option for a Friends tab but you can't add anyone through matches or invite them that way. At least, no way I have figured out.

Not like i'd want to invite people who literally spend all their time in 1 point on the map and don't even try to win anyway.

 [*][b]Gameplay[/b]
The basic gameplay is very similar to Far Cry 3. You have campaign missions, side missions, liberate towers, and of course attack outposts. The biggest gameplay differences are throughout the main campaign you have two leaders arguing and you always need to be the decider. Second gameplay difference is now there are fortresses, which are a lot more fun too attack since they pose a little more difficulty. Third, the map being based in the hills has a lot more opportunities to make use of the grappling hook and the wing-suits. Finally the side missions are a lot more common and varied to keep it interesting even after you have finished the main campaign. A Quick side note, the economy is unballenced but since it is only in single player it isnt to horrible that way. I know I still have a ton of the map to explore. Overall the gameplay was familiar and I really enjoyed it but it didn't feel like an exact replica of Far Cry 3, they really improved the base model of gameplay

 [*][b]Graphics[/b]
I have a custom built hi-end PC and I was able to take full advantage of the high graphics quality. Everything from the characters to the terrain to the animals all looks so amazing and only a few games able to compare with that level. I know that for people with lower end computers it may not be as important, but for someone who can run it, the graphics are amazing. I understand many (too many) players have had issues with the game from black screens to frame stuttering, I have not had these issues since the launch day but I hope Ubisoft fixes them all for everyone's sake. 

 [*][b]Story[/b]
While I was very skeptical of the story having to follow the amazing story brought to us in Far Cry 3. That being said the story is very well written. It has plenty of hooks and switches to keep you guessing from the start. One thing I will mention that there are several opportunities to shoot a person before they tell you their part of the story, I just wish that was a little more obvious so nobody misses any.

 [*][b]Sounds[/b]
As usual the background music for the whole story was amazing as well as all the sound effects. Everything fit very well together and made the game one step closer to perfection.

 [*][b]My Closing Opinion[/b]
I loved the game. I do feel that the story was unable to match Far Cry 3 but was still amazing. I love the vehicles and coop was a nice addition. I know I will still be playing this game every second of my free time for probably another month or two. I know I still have plenty of submissions and collectibles lying around to keep me entertained for a while.

- You can't play all the game in coop ( ""balance"" mission is unaviable in coop)
- No chat, and that's sucks in coop 
- Some littel bugs ( peopole and enemies pooping)
- You need a monster computer for enjoy it perfectly 64 Bits, 8Go, R9 290 or better ...

- Amasin graphics 
- Amasing story 
- Better coop mode than far cry 3

I end up thinking i should get this com tower for map vision, then maybe this outpost for fast travel, but then you get a radio message saying meet some guy to help him out, AND as your doing that a enemy convoy appears that if you chase it down it will give you massive exp so you end up doing that. Next thing you know 2 hours has passed and you never did a single story mission.

13035797,76561198071829047,"If you liked Far Cry 3, go for it! The game really feels like an updated version of the 3rd installment, which as a whole isn't a bad thing. 

Pros
1) Stunning scenery...part of the reason I loved the Far Cry 3 is the huge, beautiful world you're put into. If anything, they surpassed my expectations; Far Cry 4 has a variety of different environments depending on where you are on the map. 
Graphics as a whole look great as well.

2) Core gameplay very similar to Far Cry 3 - definitely a good thing! What's more, they've included small improvements such as auto-crafting health syringes, marking downed animals on the mini map, an auto-drive feature, and other cool features. Even the UI has been improved.

3) The wildlife is much more engaging. So far I'm in the first area and I feel that the wildlife really adds a level of challenge to the mix. Hoping to see more of that going forward...not too much more though.

Cons
1) It almost feels a little too similar to the 3rd one sometimes. Looking at the skill tree, there's not too many new skills. The good part is they've kept most, if not all the skills from the last game, so if you liked the skill tree, then it can kind of be viewed as a good thing. When all is said and done though, I can't help but think that they could of added a little more variety.

2) This is kind of a personal gripe, but as much as I enjoy the wildlife encounters in the game so far, I have to say the eagle has to be one of the most obnoxious enemies in the game to date. This might just be bad luck or the areas I've been in, but I get attacked constantly by these goddamned birds. Part of the problem is melee doesn't seem to work on them (please someone correct me if I'm wrong) - whenever they get 10 to 15 metres from your character, he automatically goes into a defense animation, making you unable to do anything but watch your lifebar get drained. And the animation doesn't wound the bird - in fact, most of the time the eagle will fly away, and then come back to attack you, moments after you've fended him off. I know it seems like a silly gripe, but when you're surveying an outpost or something requiring stealth and these birds attack, you can't exactly start shooting in the sky like a madman. To make matters worse, the bird doesn't even give out anything useful, just some garbage feathers. I'm not even sure why they included this enemy in the game, I'm no eagle expert but last I checked, birds generally don't attack people unless you're after their eggs or something. 

EDIT: After another 7 hours of playing and I've only been attacked once! That's not to say I haven't seen any eagles.. I've seen plenty I assure you, they just seem to find the NPCs before they find me. I guess it was just bad luck in the end that I was getting attacked constantly. Still, the amount of times I hear a member of the Golden Path scream ""Watch out! An Eagle!"" is mind-blowing.

3) I've heard a lot of negativity about the story in previous reviews. I can't comment too much on that given how far I've gotten, but so far it's alright. Not great, but not bad. If the game is fun (which it is), I tend to kind of look past issues with the main storyline. Honestly with all the side quests and junk to do, you tend to forget the story bit sometimes. At least I do.

Closing Comments
If I had to go back, I'd probably wait for a sale to buy it (or maybe not, I'm kind of impatient), but it's still a great game so far. If you like Far Cry 3 or have never tried it, you'll be sure to enjoy it. If you didn't like Far Cry 3, avoid this game as the core gameplay is essentially identical.

The main issue is this being poorly optimized for PC. There are visual glitches and bugs galore. I've only played this for about 6 hours so far and can say that the majority of this time was spent trying to get the visuals to work properly so that I can actually see what I'm doing in the game. So far here are the issues I've personally run into on my current gaming rig with the latest drivers and having tested this game on all the different settings:

- Missing Textures
Straight out of the gate, as soon as I made my way outside into the (supposedly) beautiful outdoors, there are missing textures, painting parts of the ground black. Reloading the save made these textures come back, only to find some others disappear later.

- Black Shadows
This is meant to be an HBAO+ issue with SLI setups. However I don't have an SLI setup. Changing the setting to SSAO doesn't fix this problem. It might for some people, but not here. At first I thought this must be an issue with the colour - maybe I needed to down the contrast and up the brightness? Not the case. Not sure what's causing this. At night time the game it is unplayable - you cannot see anything except for the silhouette of the tops of trees, the sky and the mountains.

- Pixelated close-up shadows on all settings
Not sure why this is happening but the shadows do appear very pixelated on characters faces on all settings in cutscenes.

- Dark sky
Maybe this is the way the game is supposed to look, but I doubt it. The sky is a very dark blue, making the surrounding mountains and clouds appear very light in contrast during daytime and night time - which isn't a big deal. But it does appear quite strange and looks nothing like the screenshots of the ps4 and xbox one versions.

- Water reflections turn purple.
Again must be a missing texture problem.

There's more issues I can list on here but I'm sure you get the general idea.

This isn't a bad game. Most of these issues are not reflective of the gameplay or what is in here content-wise. And maybe there are people out there who won't mind these issues. But when you're paying the same amount of money for a PC version of a game (or in the case of us here in Australia, MORE money) which turns out to be an inferior version... the logical conclusion is don't spend your money on this game.

This is a revisit review:

The Game has been patched and a it took longer than anticipated.
The Nvidia option setting is gone but there are still some nvidia specific options available now including Simulated Fur option. 
Normal Fur:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364254361

Simulated Fur:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364254410

The Fur option looks great but tends to kill framerates.
I can now fully recommend this game for purchase although lower end systems may still have to lower settings to medium and turn off certain features to gain an acceptable framerate.
But that is for each to decide themselves.

Below is the original review:


In short: I would wait for the patch to be released next week:

After spending 1hr trying to get this game to work at all I cannot recommend it in it's current state:
I had to, not only remove all usb (non Essential) devices, but also track down and disable the drivers.
Game started after all that but had Non responsive black window before that.
The day 1 patch will be out next week ( go Figure), which should address the black screen issue.

Once running all was good, for a while. Framerates were ion the High 90-130 range ( sli 780gtx) on Ultra and nvidia mode, untill I noticed a strange and annoying problem.

Some of the previous screens seemed to be shadowed onto current sceens. ( hard to explain ) In shadows I could see a table with some bottles on it which seemed to be drawn over whatever current sceene I was looking at. This only got worse in the open terrain.
I uploaded a screen shot but you may not see the effect.

Tigers take 2 arrows to kill, badgers take 5.

You catch fire by standing near a flame.
The stealth is a joke, the AI automatically knows where you are if you snipe/use the bow.

The campaign however, did not met my expectations. The main protagonist is in my opinion not so interesting, neither is the main villain Pagan Min. The storyline lacks the originality, which the storyline of far cry 3 had. 

I also want to mention the poor optimization for this game. I have an Amd radeon 7850 royalking GPU and a good CPU, but no matter on which video settings I am playing this game, it's lagging all the time. I've seen Far Cry 3 looking much more beatiful than this game and that says a lot.

If you play games like Far Cry just for the campaign missions, this game isn't your game to play. Fortunately this game has more to offer. Exploring Kyrat is lots of fun, but after a while the random events get boring and you realise all the side quests are kind of the same. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone, but not for 60$.

Fun game unfortunatley it was more absed on takedowns for the combat rather than cool gun tricks which I can live with. The Issue was the skills seemed bland, nothing too exciting same with the 3rd.

I haven';t bothered trying to make sense of it, I just went with it and managed to get a somewhat submersive experience.

... But dont expect the same kind of character depth and straightforwardness of the plot.

The ""insanity"" is back but instead of people losing their minds in the jungle and the line between sanity and insanity being blurred, the characters in FC4 are in-your-face insane. Characters talk at you rather than with you.

Whereas in FC3, Buck-a clearly sadistic psychopath-tells you to get something for him or he will rape your brother again; FC4 has Longinus, a former African War lord who quotes/shouts bible passages at you and gets uncomfortably close.

FC3's plot was wonderful because of how simple it was. You crash on an island, your friends get kidnapped. Get your friends, kill the pirates. Not much thought required, not much justification required. The game made up for it in character richness.

So far FC4's plot justiication has something to do with a political feud and you are involved because your parents were involved and there are terrorists and not terrorists... etc. The point is, you dont fall into the role like you could with FC3.

Aside from that, the gameplay is FC3+, they reused a lot of the same animations and sound files. Added a couple new animals. Hit boxes seem smaller so sniping is a bit tricker. 

Framerate drops occassionally but I can run on ~high settings (GTX 660TI, 8gbRAM, AMD FX6300)

Needs some balancing tweaks, the skill tree doesnt have many skills I would want to put points into (because it would make the game too easy) and the skills I would want are unlocked with next-to-no effort.

Looking forward to a ""Ziggy's HardCore Mod""

All in all, a fun game! Way better than Unity but I find myself missing FC3 a little when I play it.

The good, the bad, and the ugly.

The good:

I came, I played, I got killed by a tiger...

It's fun, no arguing that.  Gliders? Yea they are here, but those are really a FarCry3 sort of thing. This is FarCry4, we use Wingsuits. I've spent some time zooming across the map and find myself trying to reach higher places to jump from just for the visual and fun of flying through trees, and just bearly making it over a crest to another opening then deploying just before hitting the ground. 

The AI is reasonably smart, and if you take some time with your camera or sniper rifle you can see them doing some funny things. Through my scope I found one of the factions members taking cell phone photos of a propaganda poster on a radio tower just before I joined part of him with it.

Elephants... Not only can you ride them, you can use them to call others.... Need to storm the castle? Break through that front door with a pack, that's how you make an enterance!

Co-op is... Fun! If you have a mic. The in game comunication is limited, salute for yes, give the finger for no, and a few other minimallist commands. 

Uplay's Reward for Playing features, more points, more in game goodies!

The random encounters with animals, Karma events, and ""other"" things (I don't want to add any spoilers for those who are just looking into the game.) keep it fresh. 

There are small personal hellicopters, these are a great way to get around, get to a high enough altitude to flight suit, or to have a co-op buddy grapple onto so you can sling them over top and have them land in the blades... Death from above off of a ledge? Thats for noobz! Death from above from a chopper? That's more like it, just don't be flying it when you jump down to kill the enemy. It hurts when it lands on you... 

One of these Rino's is not like the other...
Rino's seem to be the bad ass of the jungle. Come near them and they may just go on a rampage and kill everything around you... Yes everything, not just everyone. Really? What did that little K car do to you Rino? It was a good Reliant Automobile! ...Some times they are rather easy to dispatch. 2 shots with the elephant gun and down they go, other times, 4 shots in the head with a high powered sniper, 3 shots in the face as it charges with the elephant gun and a box of bullets from your buddies LMG and you MIGHT have finally put it down. This might be bug, not sure, but I like it. Makes you think twice about using them for bait meat and skins.

The bad:
It uses Ubisoft's Uplay (This list of reasons why this is terible is long. The only thing I actually like is that players get rewarded with content for playing the games. This is great, everything else.. bad... bad Uplay! Go to your room...)
Still, it's better than Origin.

Ubisofts match making is usually so bad that you can't play games with others unless the moon is in perfect alinement, some alien force is boosting reception and all planets in our galaxy have alined.  This time? Not that bad, however all the advertising about ""Play with up to 10 of your friends!!!!"" Is a bit missleading. You can play with 1.... not 10, 1 for co-op. If you want to play PVP then yes you can play with 10. Uplay doesn't have a ""Recently played with"" section to add friends, so if someone is a terrible troll you can't easily find and block them, and if someone is awesome, the same problem. 

The game has some glitches, some quite amuzing... But mostly annoying, and mostly in co-op. Single player has been mostly smooth.

STEAM overlay doesn't work at 2160 res (4k) I love the overlay so this is a bummer.

It's Dark at night.
No kidding right? you know what, hold on.


The ugly:
^^There. It's DARK at night, and in any shadow in the game if you are using SLI. When I say dark, I mean black. No increase in brightness helps, that just changes the black to grey with no texture to see still. 
I wouldn't care if I could control equiping my flashlight, and if the AI was just as blind as I was (animals excluded of course, they should be able to see you still.) Saddly that's not the case, you don't get to see anything and they can see you still as if it was daylight out. This seems to be a issue only effecting SLI users and I'm looking forward to a fix. I'll update this once it get's one.



In the end it's a fun game with a few bugs but nothing game breaking. It's not FarCry3. The story moves much slower than in that game, but the world seems larger as well. You get a little choice about what you do in the game so far as ""who to help"" and such. So far as story goes though FarCry3 imo had it much better. I had a reason to fight in that game, a reason to step up and risk my life... In this game, I'm here dropping off my moms ashes and figured, what the hell... Let's play with drug dealers, freedom fighters, and a tyrant.... Not nearly as good of a reason to get involved except ""I'm here so why not"" I also look like a D-bag from Jersey Shore and my partner in crime ""Turk"" used to star in East Bound and Down but hey... Turk in all fairness is awesome.

You can say the story i rather further spread in this one.
And the semi-side-main-whatever-missions are also comparable to the main quest in taste, fun and presentation.

Ofc you have the standard side quests just like in FC3. But overall you have way more to do and the nerw world is far more beautiful then in the previous parts.

I really do like the game and there is only one thing i really miss here and dont like at all.
Thats to be found in the multiplayer.

13026835,76561198077731596,"Fun as always, Playing farcry series since a long time and i liked all of them ( FC2 was a bit boring)
this time, FC4 is good but could be more worked out.
Animations and GUI are the same as FC3 and Blood Dragon.
they didn't really worked on this and concentrated on the map and the missions

Nothing really new in FC4, but still funnyon a High-end pc and some missions are really funny.

Some good new mechanics:
- Shooting when driving
- Mounting Elephant :D
- Bigger Map - Bigger playground
-  the atmosphere, the playground
- Chopper flying :D
- many secondary missions

Some things i didn't liked:
- Same animation, same GUI, same mechanics
- some technical issues with Hardware ( joystick / ATI graphic Cards)
- Some Crashes
- not enough weapon choice ON YOU.  (only 2 hand-weapons and 2 primary..)
- Some Sound issues.
- BO is not really linked to the environnement.
- Some stealth mechanics are not well-handled.
- The Story is a bit shitty, and the hero ( another tourist ) is in a short way capable of killing everyone without any moral issue.
- the background of the hero is not well introduced


but clearly a Game to recommend for all FC Fans even if it's a copy from FC3 with a little more graphic options on the same engine and a new map.

Ubi actually spent time to test this and make sure it functioned as a finished game on release. Not an early beta version like another game recently released *cough* *cough* ACU *cough.*

It's also worth noting that if you have Nvidia cards in SLI, you absolutely need to download the latest Nvidia driver released just a couple days ago. They already have a perfectly functioning SLI profile for this game. Granted, I have 2 780Ti K|ngp|n in SLI. The game ran at around 50 fps on one card. Now with the SLI working, it runs at 60 easily and the graphics cards are barely getting over 50 degrees.

Don't let other poorly functioning games of recent history scare you away from this release. It works extremely well at ultra settings. You don't need to wait for patches for this game to be good. If you enjoy the Far Cry series or even just open world games, this one won't disappoint. Definitely worth playing until they fix the failed experiment that is Assassin's Creed: Unity.

You can interact with the enviorment and they even added fortresses which are just bigger, harder out posts but i like it. This game in my opinion is also a bit harder than 3 was. I thought Far Cry 3 was a bit too easy, even on the hardest difficulty. This game seems a bit more challenging. I recommend this game to any FPS/Adventure/Open World gamers and of coarse any fans of Far Cry 3. Far Cry 4 is great and i rate it a 8.5 out of 10. The only things i didn't really like about it is how similar it really is to Far Cry 3, lag issues but i think they fixed most of it, and not enough new weapons at all. There are some good new signatures but that's it.

13023966,76561198082509206,"Good game. Bad UPlay. This game is similar to Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon. Nothing much has changed. Still, this is a fun game

GAMEPLAY:
You start off weak and have almost nothing. Similar mechanics to FC3 with a different story. If you enjoy the previous FC, you will enjoy this one. It took me almost 10 hours to finish Act 1 (starting from the Prologue, at a relaxed, I am collecting everything pace), so I think it will yield more than 80 hours of game time.

CONTROLS / PHYSICS:
Controls aren't bad. The mouse look takes some getting used to. Vehicle physics are bad either. Animals and vehicles belonging to air, land and water are present and can be interacted with.

GRAPHICS:
It has a demanding engine. So far, I can play on the highest settings at 1080. My GTX 770 is almost always at 100% load when playing. On my i7-4770k (3.5 GHz quad core \\ Hyperthreading \\ 64 bit), it has 20-35% load when playing, and it has more than 40% load when loading game files.

Despite the high requirements, it still has some flaws. Some NPCs suddenly appears (meaning they are not loaded in advanced properly). The good side of it is that the scenery looks gorgeous. The fur on animals also look beautiful. The fur on Amita's coat sometimes look blurred, though. The skin and flesh tone are above average compared to other games.

Most tearing disappeared and performance improved when I increased the field of view (FOV). Curious.

MUSIC / SOUNDS:
The music used are not out of place. Everything that can be interacted with has its own sound effects. Audio production of everything in-game hasn't failed yet (meaning there's no skipping audio). Environmental sounds are present and can be made good use of. Audio positioning are, at many times, confusing; except for gunfire, which its position can be determined right away.

UPLAY:
Before playing the game, you must have UPlay. Activate Far Cry 4 by inputting the CD key into UPlay if you have the Gold Edition and have the Season Pass, there are 2 keys to input.

Some features are only accessible from UPlay. You need to spend UPoints, which can be earned by playing Ubi's games, for some of the weapons, soundtrack, wallpapers, etc. When pressing F12 for the screenshot, UPlay will also notify you that you have taken a screenshot.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Despite UPlay... just get this game.

My RIg:
Gforce Nvidia GTX 760  4 gig vram Striker  - gpu
AMD FX 8350 8-core - cpu
Resolution: 1920 x 1080 - 60hz
8G-Ram
windows 8.1
Controller (x360) + Kb/mouse

Pros: 
Awesome graphics and gameplay, open world
Really good AI, The AI actually flank you if you let them
Many, many different things to do
Easy manual optimization of graphics
Co-op (this is good as well as bad) - interferes with fps, Uplay makes it harder to use with steam
40-70 fps on Ultra
Great story line
Many tactical options
You can fly around the world in a buzzer!!

Cons:
Uplay:  Uplay is a good program but redundant with steam. Steam is easier to use
Coop (this is good as well as bad) - interferes with fps, Uplay makes it harder to use with steam - Once again redundant

Real review below
EDITED on Nov 22

Farcry 4 is a build on what made farcry 3 good, and attempts to fix some things associated with it. Some things were fixed, some were not, and some were broke. 

=The Good=

-More guns, always good, literally the game designers seem to have said ""Lets keep most of FC3's guns, but then add a ton of awesome guns from all time zones"". Only complaint is the sawed off forces you to shoot both barrels at once, but in all honesty thats a small complaint, the thing is death, literally, death used to carry this gun under his cloak and it fell out when he was hiking in kyrat. 

-More area to discover and explore

-much more stuff to do

-replayable outpost missions

-dont have to stare at hands the whole game, now you get gloves! (Cant be changed but still)

-Added gyrocopters

-Co op in main game, with hurk, a man with brilliance unmatched 

-can shoot one handed weapons from driver seat (But oddly cant use two handed ones from passenger seat?)

EDIT:-There are more random things to do now than there were, from chasing couriers to blowing up caravans, but these events take a matter of seconds and dont really challenge the player. I Took down a convoy of three vehicles with 3 shots from a shotgun, without leaving my vehicle. the fun missions, assassinations, hostage rescues and the like, are not replayable. 

EDIT: WOW! Just looked in the options menu, not only are outposts replayable, you can actually RESET them ALL to hostile, that is awesome. This allows players to replay the game in a more hostile setting even after beating it, and means, unlike the outpost master replay things, you can actually approach the outpose how you see fit, big Plus here

=The unchanged=

-Some weapons have an utterly paltry amount of attatchements and many are completely made 
obsolete late game, something i always despise. (This isnt as bad as FC3 though, im still using the mauser to good effect late game and it was an early game pistol, still wish i could mod it)

-the wing suit still kills you more often than you actually get to use it. Likes to turn on when trying to get takedowns or jumping roof to roof, carreening you into a wall and instant death

-Lacking enemy selection, despite being a dictatorship and rich, pagan's forces have no tanks, no real military vehicles, etc. 

-0 Customization, you are this kid, Ajay Ghale, nothing more, theres some story to him but its really pretty simple. no clothing changes, and very limited weapon customizing, hes less of a stupid teen than Jason was though, which is nice. 

-Signature weapons are still around, yuck, i wanna make my own killing tool, not use one the game designers cooked up. 

-Uplay means you need another game launcher and as a result, more lag.

=The Broken =

-no save slots, so once youve beat the game with whatever choices you made, if you wanna try again, start all over, erasing data.

-Extremely laggy and prone to locking up at bad times, reminds me of malaria from farcry 2, i have a REALLY good computer and it still lags on LOW settings. EDIT: Recent patch has made it less laggy, still cant put it on high graphics without the computer locking up, but theres less lag overall. 

-Simple, lacking story. Not so bad considering you are only gonna do it to unlock stuff and then go play with said stuff, but still. it would be nice to look forward to story missions instead of loathing them. 

-While there is far more choice in this story compared to farcry 3, its still always gonna end with the player mostly unhappy with how it went. 

-Once you make a certain choice, a big part of the story literally bloody disappears and nothing further happens (Bahdra)

-Pagan is extremely interesting but doesnt show up at all really, save for little radio calls every now and then, and if you make the moral choice in the end thats that, the game is over. You can now run about playin' around wondering what really was going on. Wanna try the other ending? restart the game, all over....EDIT: It honestly seems like the gaming trend is to make the player regret their choices no matter the ending. I read the other path, to see what happens if you dont shoot in the end, and honestly shooting is still the right choice BUT you miss out on ALOT of plot, so i recommend not shooting. 

-Dying shortly after missions can cause important mission info to not be told over the radio, and you can miss out on plot

EDIT:- The devs seem to feel a need to put mass drugs into these games, to get completion, you have to subject Ajay to the same trippy treatment in a questline of about...5 missions? each is almost literally unchanged from the last. You wake up in Kyrat with pink and green fog, and run to three checkpoints looking for the two who gave you the drugs, then it ends. Very uninteresting missions, I dont think they should be there honestly, seem to exist just so the devs can stick needles in Ajay


I will add more as i play

WAYS TO FIX CERTAIN BUGS
If you find your car is trying to drive itself or auto aim is on, go into options, to gamepad, and turn those to manual and off, etc. The game thinks you have a remote and is trying to set up for that. 

If certain parts of your sound go out, fast travel somewhere and it should be fixed. It seems going to certain outposts can maks some sounds, such as reloading, stop working

==Do i recommend this game? ==
yes, its fun, despite all this. in the moments where there is no lag, no stupid guy on the radio singing praises to a drug queen, you can have legit fun. Maybe not customized to perfection, but still. You CAN have fun and WILL, often even. Flying a gyrocopter and blasting cars below with a grenade launcher is fun, chasing a truck weildding a double barrel shotgun in one hand from an ATV is FUN!",1416529969,1417220552,1,0.7665378451347351,4869,2346,1554600436,"{""recommendationid"": ""13022122"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198039394097"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 167, ""playtime_forever"": 4869, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 2346, ""last_played"": 1554600436}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""10/10  Would share Crab Rangoon with a mad king again\n\n\nReal review below\nEDITED on Nov 22\n\nFarcry 4 is a build on what made farcry 3 good, and attempts to fix some things associated with it.

Pro: 
- Good Graphics
- Kind of vivid World
- Nice protagonists (I'll come back on that one)
- Open World
- Partially Customization
- ""Open-World"" Coop
- Many Side-Quests (coming to that one later)
- Map Editor
- Very good Motion-Capture
- Sometimes you really get funny WTF Moment's, trust me I've been laughing my ass off sometimes just by exploring the world and doing stuff.
- Some new Vehicles. F.e. Gyrocopter

Contra:
- Pretty similiar to Far Cry 3 which doesn't have to be a negative thing
- The optimization isn't good yet 
 I get 60 fps with vsync on ultra and turning off some small stuff but there still are framedrops at certain points like fire for example.
- You are Ajay Ghale, the son of the creator of the Golden Path ""Molan Ghale"". But you're stuck between 2 People: Sabal and Amita - Whatever you do it is kind of wrong since one of them needs this the other one needs that.
- You came to this country to leave the ashes of your Mother and then you just become a one man army Warrior just out of the sudden? Come on.
- There are plenty of side quests but they're pretty much the same f.e. ""Armored Escort"" is pretty much the same with different routes.
- Map Editor not available for competetive game modes.
-uPlay


My personal conclusion is that Far Cry 4 is a big World with Animals, plants, a crafting and a skill system nontheless it still seems to be Far Cry 3 just wtih a new HUD and Story. Some weapons arent customizable anymore because they sell f.e. the AK in a different ""Signature"" Design which has stuff on it but is pretty expensive. Also you gotta liberate all Outposts just to get one damn good sniper rifle which is pretty expensive though so its pretty useless in the end. Also there are some things that could have made the game better just small things like adding a skip function for cutscenses....but no they didnt do that whenever you leave a mission YOU ARE FORCED TO WATCH THEM.....also just adding some kind of inventory loadout at the beginning of the mission would have made things so much easier.......but noo....they didnt wanted to do that. It is really annoying to get forced to watch every Cutscene over and over and over again just because they were to lazy to add small things that would have improved overall game experience. Aside that there still are technical performance problems and they really have to fix them, this is a TRIPLE A Title with a Season Pass,but....???! the game isnt proper made yet. This is kind of a BETA right now.

To be honest I've only been playing Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, and I had great fun with these. But Far Cry 4 doesnt justify it's pricetag with a new story, some new settings, rerendered guns from FC3 which are basicaly the same weapons, technical problems and a goddamn season pass for a Beta Game.  Paying for Content that actually belonged in the released game....... Also the game is kind of unoptimized and people still encounter issues. Also uPlay is hugely untrustworthy with its servers and so on.

If you wan't to play it it's up to you. For me as a former Far Cry 3 Player I feel kind of scammed by its price tag.

13019984,76561197963473570,"While I recommend this game, it does come with some caveats.

First the good: this game is fun. It's all the good parts of Far Cry 3 updated and polished with an excellent curry flavoring.

There is tons to do, and, for a person like me with ADHD, it honestly feels great getting constantly sidetracked by something new off in the distance.

Now the bad: Uplay is obviously an issue. It's a secondary platform on top of Steam that is redundant and as undesirable as prostate cancer. I mean, the damn game starts up Uplay which then tells you it's launching the game through Steam! This is heretical amounts of redundancy!

13019824,76561198061821567,"This is definitely my favourite game that I've played yet.

I'll start off with the negatives, incase any of these are a deal breaker for you:
[list]
[*]The graphics are pretty demanding, so unless you have an amazing rig, I'd advise expecting to run it on the lower options.  I am using AMD everything, basically, and I've found that most of the issues AMD users were reporting early on have already been fixed (either by Ubisoft or AMD). 
[*]There are some parts where waves upon waves of enemies will be spammed at you - more than in the weed burning mission in FC3. This is really a matter of opinion, though, and can be pretty fun at times.
[/list]

The positives:
[list]
[*]My computer is quite a bit below the minimum specs recommended, and the game still works quite well most of the time. Granted, I had to update my video driver (as you do), and change a few settings in the GamerProfile.xml that weren't accessible ingame, but it worked in the end.
[*]Assuming you do have a decent computer, the graphics are seriously nice.
[*]A fairly detailed & colossal map.
[*]All of the old guns from FC3 are still here, if you had any favourites. Most people seem to be treating this as negative, but I have absolutely no problem with it, given that:
[*]Heaps of cool new weapons aswell. Most notably: an automatic crossbow, the M79 GL (which is treated as a sidearm), throwing knives (extremely accurate, silent, ranged weapons which you throw using the grenade key), and sticky variants of your favourite bombs - your grenades, mines, and C4 can now stick to whatever you throw them at - best of all, this option is toggleable on the go. There's also bait, which is thrown like a grenade to lure nearby hostile animals, which there are always a few of.
[*]Some weapons are now considered ""sidearms"". All this means is that they can be used in certain situations where others couldn't be - most notably, when driving any vehicle. The downside is that one of your weapon slots can only hold sidearms - however, the other 3 can also hold sidearms, if you want to have multiple. 
[*]A fair few new animals - from the small honey badgers, which are terrifyingly vicious, to the much larger rhinos & elephants.
[*] You can ride the elephants! They may seem like a gimmick, but they are a huge amount of fun. I haven't seen any outside of quests, and maybe an outpost, though. I wouldn't recommend using a RPG while you're on it though, they uh, don't survive the blast too well. Or at all really.
[*]Ever wanted to race a tuk tuk? Probably not, but now you can anyway!
[*]Gyrocopters - by far the most convenient mode of transport, only losing in style to any elephant.
[*]A grappling hook, which can only be used in specific spots. It adds a nice bit of variance to climbing puzzles, and provides a good number of alternate routes to various places.
[*]Adopts the alternate approach system from Far Cry 2 for some of the main quests, meaning that you get to choose from two different ways to deal with the mission. If you care for immersion, it can make for some pretty interesting choices.
[*]Far more random encounters, with greater variance. It can be quite fun to save a couple of hostages while moving towards your goal, or to stop a honey badger terrorizing an innocent civilian (and get paid for it).
[*]Huge amount of notes, books, and other information lying around in game which enriches the story setting nicely. If you like reading about game lore, then you'll probably be happy with this.
[*]Greater variance in voice acted lines, and a great amount of contextual lines - for example: I've heard people saying things specific to the outpost they were in after I'd liberated it.
[*]Improved AI - I had no complaints with the AI in FC3, but it's definitely better here.
[*][spoiler]Wish you could've sided with Hoyt in FC3 (who doesn't)? Well, there's a secret ending that lets you peacefully end the game by siding with Pagan Min. Pretty snazzy detail, I think.[/spoiler]
[*]The sidequests are plentiful, and much improved. If you were planning on skipping over them and just following the main questline, I'd really advise giving them a try.
[*]The HUD is fairly customizable, to a point which should make fans of ziggy's mod happy.
[*]New weapon/crafting wheel system, which can be extremely handy, especially since it can toggle sticky bombs, and craft + use syringes on the go, although it can take a little getting used to.
[/list]

Skills and equipment have been rebalanced, with some things that were skill dependant in FC3 now being available by default, or obtained through other methods. For example: instead of having a skill to get 2 skins from a single animal, you just have to make it a 'clean kill' instead - using bolts, arrows, or your kukri instead of bullets/fire/explosions. The wingsuit is now available from the start, I believe. It can be obtained in the shop for about 25 grand, by picking it up for free in a couple places, or somehow not obtaining it long enough for it to be given to you during a mission.

The story, while seen from the point of view of the main character, is far less centered on him than it was on Jason Brody in Far Cry 3. While I'm a little sad about this, it also pays off hugely because it enables the story to focus more on the struggles of the country, from the over all civil war, the condition of the Golden Path group, to minor details like a son's father being killed for trying to set up a free radio station. This results in a fairly rich environment, and I found that it added a whole lot more depth to the game world.

I've missed a whole lot of great points, but it's an extremely fun game, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone.

Edit: I've finished the main story, but definitely not all of the game, so I'll finish off my review by adding that by the end, I loved the story.

It can be obtained in the shop for about 25 grand, by picking it up for free in a couple places, or somehow not obtaining it long enough for it to be given to you during a mission.\n\nThe story, while seen from the point of view of the main character, is far less centered on him than it was on Jason Brody in Far Cry 3. While I'm a little sad about this, it also pays off hugely because it enables the story to focus more on the struggles of the country, from the over all civil war, the condition of the Golden Path group, to minor details like a son's father being killed for trying to set up a free radio station. This results in a fairly rich environment, and I found that it added a whole lot more depth to the game world.\n\nI've missed a whole lot of great points, but it's an extremely fun game, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone.\n\nEdit: I've finished the main story, but definitely not all of the game, so I'll finish off my review by adding that by the end, I loved the story. It has high replayability - both the gameplay and the story, since you can choose alternate paths which affect both."", ""timestamp_created"": 1416514768, ""timestamp_updated"": 1434166007, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 75, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.749343454837799072"", ""comment_count"": 4, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

PROS:
GRAPHICS- They're beautiful , so so smooth. This is the first ""pretty"" game I've put my new rig though (i7-4790K, GTX 780Ti, 16GB RAM). Hardly any glitches***, which is weird from a Ubisoft game.

NEW MECHANICS- I love being able to shoot out of vehicles, using elaphants as living tanks, and the tiny chopper helps with getting around the map.

HUGE MAP- So much to explore, see, and do, I'm still scratching the surface.

COMBAT- As much fun as Far Cry 3, which is good because that didn't need to be fixed. No greater feeling than jumping on top of a heavy and ruthlessly stabbing him through his big stupid chest.

WILDLIFE- More interactive and adds to the emergent gameplay. A rhino unexpectedly helped me take out a convoy, but then promply turned on me. I was forced to kill him with a Grenade Launcher which is all kinds of wrong.

WEAPONS- An armory full of fun. They even brought back a lot of the signature weapons from 3 and added plenty more. #Bushman4Lyfe

CONS: 
STORY- Not as good as 3's in my opinion. Choosing which Golden Path mission you're going to take sucks because no matter what you choose, something goes wrong and then the other leader gets all butt hurt at you for not listening to them. Also, there is no explanation as to how Ajay became such a badass all of a sudden. In 3 there is a buildup of badassness and a few skills that are easily explained by the exposition. But in 4 you drop into Kyrat and can shoot, fly, climb, hunt, craft, and of course mercilessly kill people pretty much from the get go.

PRICE TAG- As I mentioned at the top, I regret paying $90 for the Gold version and season pass. If some good DLC's come around I'll change my mind. But it's no great enlightenment that video game companies are making a killing off suckers like me who preorder these games at full price or more and find it wasn't quite worth it.

***I've heard of the mouse deceleration and black screen issues, but have yet to experience any myself. It could be that I'm running a high end rig that can handle the ""next-genness"" of this game, but I can't be sure. 

All I'm saying is that if I don't get to stab a Yeti in the face at some point I'm gonna be pissed.

Pros: Beautiful graphics, huge game world, exotic wildlife
Cons: Not enough interactivity with the environment

I personally love open-world games, and I have to put FC4 right up there among my all-time favorites in the genre.  The incredible attention to detail never ceases to impress me, especially considering the game world's immense size.  It's the unexpected, gratuitous little details that get me, like when a crocodile suddenly lunges to grab a deer walking along the riverbank and drags it under.  They didn't have to put that behavior in there: it has no effect on gameplay, and it's rare enough that you might play for weeks and never see it happen.  But IMO that's the kind of detail that makes games like this worth the big bucks you pay for them.

Combat, story, mission variety, and player progression are pretty standard for games of this type, but there is one feature that really sets FC4 apart: its wildlife.  There aren't any dragons or orcs or demons in this game, yet it still has a more varied and interesting fauna than any game I've ever played.  Despite their lack of magical abilities, every animal has a unique behavior -- they're not simply ""predators"" or ""prey"".  The flighty, deer-like sambar travel in groups of 3 or 4 and avoid everything else that moves; a pack of wolves will approach a tiger but run away when challenged; an elephant will wade into a river and spray water on its back.  And so on.  More so than any other game I've seen, the animals breathe real life into the game world.

The main complaint I have is that, for all its teeming variety, there isn't much interaction you can perform with the game world.  There are hundreds of chests scattered all over, but they only ever contain money, ammo, or generic items that can be sold for money.  There are grappling points on cliffs that can be used to scale them.  And there are a few destructable items like barrels here and there, but there's rarely ever any point (or satisfaction) in destroying them.  And that's about it!  There aren't any switches or levers to open gates or move crane arms or whatnot, or for that matter any items that you can manipulate in any way.  Although every location is unique and exquisitely detailed, the game world is more or less static.  It was actually with a sense of relief that I finally confronted the evil tyrant and beat the game, because it was beginning to border on tedious, even for an obsessive completionist like myself.",1416512023,1417609077,1,0.5,7324,7233,1417043119,"{""recommendationid"": ""13019364"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197968571832"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 41, ""playtime_forever"": 7324, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 7233, ""last_played"": 1417043119}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Summary: Great open-world exploration game, 8.5/10\nPros: Beautiful graphics, huge game world, exotic wildlife\nCons: Not enough interactivity with the environment\n\nI personally love open-world games, and I have to put FC4 right up there among my all-time favorites in the genre.

13016036,76561197984765309,"11/27/14 Edit:
This game is not without its problems, but overall, I would highly recommend it. If you are looking for huge improvements over Far Cry 3, you will probably be disappointed. The gameplay is virtually identical with its frat-boy protagonist, outposts, hunting and crafting, and missions that seem like a chore that takes you away from the real fun of the game. The real reason to purchase this game is for the co-op. Drop-in/drop-out (with a reload) co-op allowing full access to the map in its entirety with all missions and events fully accessible takes this game from an ok sequel to an awesome evolution of an already great game. It adds a level of polish that makes it everything Far Cry 3 should have been.

Now, the things that annoy me. For one, they still have not fixed the ""black screen"" crash issue. I know it has been fixed for some but it hasn't for me, despite Ubisoft's patch and insulting comments about making sure I meet the minimum requriements. I can get the game to run but only after several launch and crash attempts do I actually get to the main menu. 

Also, eagles. Ubisoft, why? You cannot walk anywhere in the game without being spontaneously assaulted from the air every five minutes by a random bird. These do not provide the game experience with any additional challenge whatsoever but serve only as a nuisance. I often find myself spending more time looking up at the sky while trudging around in the bushes than looking for men on the ground with machine guns. 

Mouse acceleration. This game has it BAD. It cannot be disabled, despite editing game configuration files and trying just about every fix one can find on Google at this point. There is a workaround if you have a mouse with adjustable DPI which is not a fix in any sense but works quite nicely as a temporary workaround until (hopefully) Ubisoft fixes the issue. If you set the in-game mouse sensitivity all the way down and set the DPI on your mouse to max (or whatever is comfortable to you), the mouse acceleration will be saturated each time you move the mouse and in turn, it will be negated. However, when entering menus, your mouse will be far to sensitive so this works best with mice that have on-the-fly DPI adjustment. 

There are many other small bugs, such as ropes getting embedded in rock faces and not allowing you to scale any higher while grappling. These things are annoying but can be dealt with. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game if you plan on playing co-op. There's just something hilariously awesome about tromping around and exploding things with a friend, or tag teaming outposts after formulating a long, thought out strategy that never seems to go as you planned. 

TL;DR: It has its annoyances, but it's way too much fun to pass up. Highly recommended.

I was never hugely into Far Cry 3. I thought there were a lot of great things about the game (the combat, the visuals, the late-game skills), but there were a lot of things that kept it from really clicking with me (environmental navigation was boring and tedious, it took way too long for the skill-tree to open up the really fun skills, roughly 90% of the voice-acting was rubbish, almost every story aspect was lazily-written [and the parts that were good were few and far between]) and with all that in mind, I was very cautious about Far Cry 4.

So far, this is the game that deserves to be dubbed ""Skyrim with guns"" or at least, far more deserving than its predecessor. Yes, much like the previous entry, Far Cry 4 has some truly atrocious caricatures masquerading as characters (which largely outnumber the game's few good characters [Pagan Min is a hoot, and Troy Baker does a wonderful job bringing him to life]), yes a large portion of skills have been ported wholesale from the last game, yes the story is dull (so far, haven't finished it yet [though I never cared about the story in Far Cry 3 in the first place]) and the fact that I still can't skip the (mostly) awful dialogue in this game puts me in a sour mood, but at least when I'm set loose into the absolutely beautiful game world that is Kyrat, I know that whatever activity I'm about to take place in will cheer me right back up again.

The single best thing I can say about this game (or at least, the thing I can't stop having a blast with) is just how fantastic getting around the environment feels. In Far Cry 3, I routinely took shortcuts down hills and slopes, and because of the (I felt it was) unpolished nature of the sandbox, I would randomly go tumbling down what appeared to be easily traversable terrain and lose large chunks of health, or worse, die. In Far Cry 4, I've only ever had an unfortunate tumble down a hill once, and to be fair, it was a steep, steep hill. Even better is the addition of the new grappling hook, which lets you ascend/descend cliffs and swing across gorges to access some hard to reach areas, or just take super quick shortcuts. Additionally, the wingsuit (which was one of the best things about Far Cry 3) takes way less time to unlock this time around. Whereas Far Cry 3 required you to be a good halfway into the game to unlock the suit, Far Cry 4 gives you the option to buy it less than three hours in, and considering the urge I get to leap off of every cliff I see (sometimes even with cliffs I just took the time to climb up), it was a wonderful decision to give this toy to play with early.

Other improvements made over the previous game include a much better economy, a reworked stim system (there aren't nearly as many arbitrary stims this time around), improved outpost liberations, better vehicles (the little ramshackle helicopter is so much fun it's almost criminal), a much more varied environment (thanks to the verticality of the map layout), and elephant riding, which never stops being both hilariously funny, and insanely empowering. 

Far Cry 4 might just be more of Far Cry 3, but that's a great thing in my book. To me, it doesn't feel like I'm getting a rehashed Far Cry 3 with some new bits and bobs; it feels like I'm getting the game I wanted Far Cry 3 to be. Think Just Cause 1 vs. Just Cause 2. Essentially the same game, but the second one took all the ideas from the first game and improved upon them to the point of making Just Cause 1 entirely obsolete.

dont cry about the game being broken or uplay to fix it... get a better computer (@the guy with the black screen problem, or the mouse acc prob)

The game works perfect,
Great animation , you can see an improvment from the previous game ,
alot more weapons , bigger map , new animals to hunt (i feel bad for killing all those rhinos)
yes , you wont have a bad guy like vaas anymore (which is sad) but the new bad guy is also awesome !
Story is epic , and well.. again to the map , such a beautiful view everywhere you go, or fly with your little heli.

there is nothing else to say basicly.. im glad i pre ordered the gold edition , one of the best pre orders i made in the last 2 years.

i havnt finished the game yet , because im still enjoying all the stuff around.
but so far i recommend to all who can to get the game!

13012918,76561198071845080,"This game is way better than the previous Far Cry 3.  The graphics are not just better, but the entire world is too.  Even though I am sure the map is smaller than 3's, the new verticality makes it seem bigger.  
The characters are a lot more likeable.  Instead of an psycopathic pirate who dies half way through, Far Cry 4 features the colorful dictator Pagan Min, who will have you questioning whose side is the good side.  
Gameplay is also better.  The Gyrocopter, grapple hook, and weapons add more first person fun than I ever experienced in any previous Far Cry.  

Of course, not everything is perfect:
The crafting system is still here, though items are easier to craft now.  Syringes autocraft, but require a skill to do so.
Skills are also still here, but require skill points to level up instead of leveling up as an achievement.  Skill Points are spent like currency, where all the first level skills cost 1 point. second level 2 points, etc.
The missions aren't always as great too.  There are missions that will require you to hunt, fetch, and diliver, but with mountains in the way of checkpoints, traversing through Kyrat is more fun than Far Cry 3.

That last (and best) thing about Far Cry 4 is the ability of customization.  The HUD is completly cuztomizable, bing able to choose what to show, what to hide, and what to limit.  
And if that wasn't enough, the settings also allow you RESET OUTPOSTS.  Personally, the biggest problme with FC3 was once I had taken over all the outposts, there were no more pirates to kill, which meant no more game to be played.  In Far Cry 4, if you have liberated all outposts, you can reset them and take them over AGAIN.  And again.  And again.

At the end, Far Cry 4 is the best this series has seen so far, but there is still room for improvement for Far Cry 5.

Sure, I had to run it through some silly recursive (launch uplay from steam. uplay wants to launch steam to play the game...)

Apparently, an unsupported USB device (read: pretty much every USB device ever, except perhaps storage drives) is causing the crash. For the record: this is 2014, nearly 2015.

While my computer still retains a PS/2 port for a keyboard, it does NOT have one for a mouse, and after disabling every USB driver possible without losing the keyboard and mouse, the game STILL crashes on startup.

Ubisoft has really dropped the ball on this one, I'm sad to say. However, they claim to be aware of the problem and promise a fix in a ""future"" patch. I may change my rating then, but I'll be remembering this.

13011463,76561198016242763,"This game is good, as to be expected.  Probably the biggest thing that I've noticed in this game compared to FC3 is the difficulty. Although I love FC3, there were quite a few issues, the difficulty being one of them.  I'm sorry, it's just that Far Cry 3 was piss easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting.  FC4 is quite a bit harder, but not to the point of being ridiculous.  I much prefer the Himilayan setting over that of the island from FC3, due to the fact that 90% of sandbox games take place either in a city, or on an island.  

Other Pros:

-Game cut down on the chatter from the main protaginost; although Jason wasn't the worst character in gaming, his need to comment on every little thing was quite annoying

-Not only new weapons, but more versatility in them, unlike in FC3 where you just stuck to like 3 guns for the first half and 3 others for the second.

-Not a white male power fantasy (they even poke fun at the franchise with co-op character Hurk)

-Being able to use the Robocop gun (IDC IF ITS FROM BD, I STILL LOVE IT)

-More things to do in general

-Little things (auto-crafting, slightly improved hunting, random encounters etc.)

CONS:

-Less memorable characters

-Somehow there's even a thinner plot than before

1. Make sure all drivers are up to date.
2. Turn of mouse acceleration. It doesnt work if you disable it in the options. (Go to Location below)
3. Go to ""My Documents\My Games\Far Cry 4\[account id name]\GamerProfile.xml"" and Search for “DisableLoadingMip0=""0""” and change the second 0 to a 1, so it should read “DisableLoadingMip0=""1""”
4. You might also want to disable motion blurr in the same text file.

After you do these things Far Cry 4 should run without massive stuttering.
Although some people are still having problems with black screens and crashing.
This is a GOOD game. It is just plagued by Massive optimization problems.
I recommend this game with caution because people are having so much trouble with it.

Pros- 
Gyrocopter

Cons-
Not enough Gyrocopters

Conclusion-
Needs more Gyrocopters

But maybe this is just a new game opinion that will change over time as the beauty of the himalayas 'breaks in'. 


Finally for the pricetag of $75, I dont think the game justifies it's cost. Don't get me wrong this is by no means a bad game, I might even call it great. Maybe it's my high expectations fueled by the outrage that a pair of gtx 780s are not being able to give me the experience that people with inferior card arrays are getting. Or maybe Farcry 3 was just a hard act to follow. I think this game belongs in the more traditional 50-60 dollar range. 

CHANGED! I am giving a negative review based upon my experience so far. Should it change and my problems solved, I will change my review for the better.

While the story is very linear, one can chose between story paths and therefore who leads the golden path, ultimately resulting in two separate endings. Even though this is fun, I would not say this is a selling point of the game.

As mentioned in my opening sentence, it is rather the amazing visuals and locations which make this game so incredible. 

I have played the game to 100 % completion three times and have 200 hours in it, which shows that one can definitely fall in love with Kyrat and play this game multiple times, if one wishes to do so. However - and this is based upon my 200 hours in it - there definitely are quite some bugs in this game, but if you look passed this, you will have a great time.

If you are a fan of Single Player games, this one is for you. 

If you are more into co-op, Far Cry 4 only allows you to attempt outposts and other aspects but not the story, which in my opinion is very sad, but was luckily fixed in the future games of the series.

13007539,76561198018518792,"Ayye let me just say though all these neagetive reviews have real points, I still reccomend this game.
It really is alot like far cry 3, which is obviously sortof sad because we wanted a true sequel.
But let me tell you whats new and great about this game.

The biggest difference is the new land of (Tebbet?) 
On high settings its aww-inspiring beutiful with the mountains, foggy valleys, fields of flowers, much differnt than the tropical jungle of far cry 3. And due to the land having so much elevation with its mountains and valleys, its much easier to use that squierl suit to bascially fly any where.

And if you can fly downward, theres usually a grapple hook spot near by that lets you go up.
There is only grapple areas in certain sections, BUT they are very common and it seems the devs put them in the best places. Like if you can drive up to a mountain that only has one path to get up, on the opposite side they probably put a hook to help you incase you came from a differnt direction. Its actually a pretty cool mechanic.

The weapons are basically the same, but for me it doesnt change that much since I think the bow is the games best aspect (fire arrows, bomb arrows, plus a weapon thats medium long range and always silenced? What else would you need)
Also a neet touch is now instead of just buying weapons and attachments for thme (which you can do with some guns) guns that already have a bundle of attachments come with a name and must be earned through the games various events. This makes getting weapons we want more rewarding and incourages us to do those random mini map events.

The story is just another tribal war scenerio exept its between a bad guy with an army who loves red hats, and a terrorist organization that doesnt like their ""leader"".  The story goes that your parents founded the terrorist and they sent you back unkowingly to finish their buisness. Thats really all Ill tell you to not spoil anything.

Overall the game offers tons of stuff to do in the most beutiful far cry environment yet. The ONLY downside, which is a biggy, is that its everything far cry 3 was and more.

I have 8 GBs of RAM, Intel Core-i5 4200, 2.5 Ghz, and decent intel integrated graphics (better that the recommended system), so I expected to run this game on low to medium graphics, with little lag but this was not the case. I turned on minimum graphics and I was getting about 20 fps. I found out it improved if I turned on some other settings, but it only jumped up to about 25 fps. This frame rate is bad, but would be playable, until you jump on a vehicle. I was doing the first quest, and wanted to get the tower faster so I jumped on a 4x4, and as soon as I started driving, it was almost impossible due to bad frame rate. I looked into it, and apparently lag is an issue on lap-tops, so hopefully they developers will release a patch to make it more compatible. Also the look mechanics are very clunky, but that may be a result of poor frame rate.

The Good: interesting characters, good story, nice map, a lot more animal/ vehicle mechanics than FC3

The Bad: bad fps on laptops, reused animations and models

I wouldn't recommend this if you do not have a very high end lap-top, as of now, but if they fix that, I would recommend it, also if you do not have a laptop.

I am excited to play it, because the last one was so much fun.\n\nEdit: I have played the game for about 40 hours now, and the game has grown on me. There seems to have been some small changes, and my fps went up. There are still a lot of graphical bugs, but it doesn't affect gameplay too much. I found the story and gameplay fun, and co-op is a blast.

+ รูปแบบการเล่นหลักๆ เหมือนกับภาคก่อน แต่กะทัดรัดและเข้าถึงได้ง่ายกว่าเดิม
+ การขี่ช้างใน Far Cry 4 เจ๋งยิ่งกว่าขี่มังกรใน Skyrim ซะอีก โดยเฉพาะตอนเอางวงฟาดศัตรูลอยข้ามหลังคาบ้าน
+ Co-op ทั้งมันส์ ทั้งฮา และเพี้ยน ในหลอดเดียวกัน
+ ปืนครกเป็นอาวุธสุดยอดของความสะใจ ใช้แล้วจะพบกับพลังทำลายล้างอันวินาศสันตะโรที่เร้าใจสุดๆ
+ เฮฮามิใช่น้อย ถ้าได้เดินทางด้วยการเอาตะขอเกี่ยวไปกับเฮลิคอปเตอร์
+ แค่ตัวร้ายอย่าง Pegan Min เพียงคงเดียวก็คุมทั้งเกมได้อยู่หมัด ทำให้เนื้อเรื่องน่าติดตามเป็นอย่างยิ่ง

13002833,76561197973120136,"I loved Farcry 1, 2, 3, and to a degree, 4. I want to give this a ""neutral"" rating. For $90, which is what I paid for the season pass and this game though? Negative. Here's why:

1) The story falls very short of the first three games, especially when compared to 1 and 3. I feel like a child caught between mommy and daddy arguing. No decision is correct, someone is always pissed off, and while there are ""consequences"" to every action, I have to listen to an NPC chew me out at the end of every mission because I chose the lesser-loser situation. Not a fun factor.

2) The much flaunted CO-OP is pretty terrible. Your CO-OP buddy can only join to help you with outposts, herb gathering, and hunting missions. Your buddy is also limited to 150 meters before they disappear off the face of the earth. It's like walking in a world where only the first player can see anything, and the second player is stuck to stare into oblivion only to support you with a few extra bullets towards a goal which is already foolishly easy. Even on hard mode, the game struggles to challenge.

3) UBI: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MULTIPLAYER? One of the great aspects of Farcry 3 was the DM, TDM, and CTF modes. You had a great thing going there. It was a very nice tribute to old school competitive gaming. With this, you do NOT have DM, TDM, nor CTF. You have a messed up version of cowboys and indians where one side gets bows, one gets guns. Sure you can argue there are abilities, but as with every other game that has attempted asymetric combat, in the end, it leads to premade groups and utter frustration. Not to mention... the ""indians"" are severely underpowered. The average player who doesn't want to gather 5 of his buddies at the same time every night is underpowered because he's stuck in the hunter-gatherer stage of life.

The good though?

-graphics are nice
-story is decent (though not as strong as 3)
-decent characters.
-runs like absolute BUTTER (maxed). Great optimizations.
-Plenty to do.
-nice entry into the seamless coop arena, but it fell short. see above.
-lots of weapons to play with and variations to explore.


Overall, I give it a 6 of 10.

I want to give this a \""neutral\"" rating. For $90, which is what I paid for the season pass and this game though? Negative. Here's why:\n\n1) The story falls very short of the first three games, especially when compared to 1 and 3. I feel like a child caught between mommy and daddy arguing. No decision is correct, someone is always pissed off, and while there are \""consequences\"" to every action, I have to listen to an NPC chew me out at the end of every mission because I chose the lesser-loser situation. Not a fun factor.\n\n2) The much flaunted CO-OP is pretty terrible. Your CO-OP buddy can only join to help you with outposts, herb gathering, and hunting missions. Your buddy is also limited to 150 meters before they disappear off the face of the earth. It's like walking in a world where only the first player can see anything, and the second player is stuck to stare into oblivion only to support you with a few extra bullets towards a goal which is already foolishly easy. Even on hard mode, the game struggles to challenge.\n\n3) UBI: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MULTIPLAYER? One of the great aspects of Farcry 3 was the DM, TDM, and CTF modes. You had a great thing going there. It was a very nice tribute to old school competitive gaming. With this, you do NOT have DM, TDM, nor CTF. You have a messed up version of cowboys and indians where one side gets bows, one gets guns. Sure you can argue there are abilities, but as with every other game that has attempted asymetric combat, in the end, it leads to premade groups and utter frustration. Not to mention... the \""indians\"" are severely underpowered. The average player who doesn't want to gather 5 of his buddies at the same time every night is underpowered because he's stuck in the hunter-gatherer stage of life.\n\nThe good though?\n\n-graphics are nice\n-story is decent (though not as strong as 3)\n-decent characters.\n-runs like absolute BUTTER (maxed). Great optimizations.\n-Plenty to do.\n-nice entry into the seamless coop arena, but it fell short. see above.\n-lots of weapons to play with and variations to explore.\n\n\nOverall, I give it a 6 of 10. Playing Farcry 3 spoiled me, and this is a rehash with a story line borderline dull, a multiplayer that made me want to shelve the game immediately, and $90 less in my pocket which I wish I would have researched more carefully.

Generally, if you liked FARCRY 3 you will like this. Many things have stayed generally the same gameplay wise. Clearing Belltowers and Outposts are just as amusing as before.

Weapons are... not amazing but not bad. Its is still very satisfying to land headshots and remove eyes with well placed arrows and throwing knives. Obviously six hours in is not saying much when it comes to what you can get your hands on later.

Animals are more annoying this time about. At first I appreciated things being agressive but when a small animal starts mauling you while you are trying to stealth an outpost it gets very old very fast. As amusing as it is to watch a single animal kill many soldiers, it brings up another point. They are strong. Generally when I throw three knives into a medium sized cat I would expect it to die. 

Characters have very good first impressions, but they loose their spark after a while. It is like seeing an amazing firework... then seeing it again... and again... ... again... and so on. Though some characters do hold more interest than others. I wish the main antagonist showed up more, though he is far more present than Vaas (FC3).

Looking at other reviews it seems FPS drops are an issue, though I never experienced these issues personally.

TL;DR: If you liked FC3 there is a very good chance that you will like FC4. If you have had not prior experience with FARCRY you may want to put some more thought into buying this game.

Many things have stayed generally the same gameplay wise. Clearing Belltowers and Outposts are just as amusing as before.\n\nWeapons are... not amazing but not bad. Its is still very satisfying to land headshots and remove eyes with well placed arrows and throwing knives. Obviously six hours in is not saying much when it comes to what you can get your hands on later.\n\nAnimals are more annoying this time about. At first I appreciated things being agressive but when a small animal starts mauling you while you are trying to stealth an outpost it gets very old very fast. As amusing as it is to watch a single animal kill many soldiers, it brings up another point. They are strong. Generally when I throw three knives into a medium sized cat I would expect it to die. \n\nCharacters have very good first impressions, but they loose their spark after a while. It is like seeing an amazing firework... then seeing it again... and again... ... again... and so on. Though some characters do hold more interest than others. I wish the main antagonist showed up more, though he is far more present than Vaas (FC3).\n\nLooking at other reviews it seems FPS drops are an issue, though I never experienced these issues personally.\n\nTL;DR: If you liked FC3 there is a very good chance that you will like FC4.

GOTY.

Gameplay speaking, it plays a lot like FC3. There's some new styles to the gameplay and there's an immense amount of verticality to it compared to the previous games. I feel like I have more options in how I want to play this time around. Alas, from the above statement, like FC2 and FC3, drivers on the road make everyone on SerbianFailBlog look like utter masters of driving finesse. Stay off the roads. For your life's sake in fact, stay *relatively far* off the roads.

Voice acting isn't bad but isn't great either. Some lines feel really forced (""Stop. Shoot. Shoot. Stop.""). Min is certainly no Handsome Jack, and he tries to 'do the funny' sometimes and it mostly just feels mediochre.

Doing missions means putting exploration on hold generally, and getting ""You're getting too far from the mission zone, continue and your mission will be aborted"" is a bit annoying... especially since the game does not really tell you how far you can stray from the waypoints before getting upset at you.

There's a few weird physics glitches, like every so often I'd kill someone and their body would be vaulted ten feet into the air. Watching one of Min's men escorting a prisoner down a hill, the two of them would keep leapfrogging over each other oddly and switching sides they were standing on. And there was a few places where shadows of trees and nearby cliffs would clash and flicker at certain camera angles. No problems getting and staying online, have yet to try multiplayer or co-op.

Watching one of Min's men escorting a prisoner down a hill, the two of them would keep leapfrogging over each other oddly and switching sides they were standing on. And there was a few places where shadows of trees and nearby cliffs would clash and flicker at certain camera angles. No problems getting and staying online, have yet to try multiplayer or co-op.\n\nWill update in a few days. So far, liking it for the most part. 4/5!

13000776,76561198029973462,"It's an ok game so far. Just ok in my opinion. This is the first far cry game I have ever played. The story is alright but irritating at times when the character your playing stays quiet when you didnt make the right 'branching decision' in their eyes and you just have to sit and take their crap. The combats fun enough but you will always be getting sidetracked with your outposts being attacked and karma missions which all feel pointless. There is a wealth of things to do but again, it all feels pointless unless its a main story mission. Rewards for side quests include: MONEY! and XP! and.... well thats about it apart from some karma which again, seems pretty pointless. 

The graphics in the game are beautiful flying around and using the glider suit are fun. I haven't expeirenced too many bugs apart from being unable to loot some corpses because they're next to walls. Controller and mouse work fine for me.

I feel its all a bit meh. There is no reason for your guy helping the people there even if his parents were from there. You the player have no idea why the dude you're playing as is a badass and can shoot, skin and make syringes. WHY? HOW DID HE GET ALL THESE SKILLS!? ITS PISSIN ME OFF! Anyway, overall not a bad game but I keep finding that I have to push myself to play in the hope that it will get better. Its not addictive or something that im that excited to play, it just.. is.

I would wait until a price drop it you want to try it out. There is probably 60$ worth of content here, the question is is it fun enough

EDIT: So i just completed the game and the story did get a lot better. Do i recommend it? Hard to say. There are some really cool things and some really not. 

The Shangri-La Quests are awesome ( I wont spoil too much) they could make a game on that place alone.

The Gameplay also gets better when the enemies get more difficult and you get more of the takedown skills, syringes etc.

However, I still find that the 2 mission characters Anita and Sabal are complete fucking retards. The game tries too hard to push difficult decisions on you so you get the feels.

Just ok in my opinion. This is the first far cry game I have ever played. The story is alright but irritating at times when the character your playing stays quiet when you didnt make the right 'branching decision' in their eyes and you just have to sit and take their crap. The combats fun enough but you will always be getting sidetracked with your outposts being attacked and karma missions which all feel pointless. There is a wealth of things to do but again, it all feels pointless unless its a main story mission. Rewards for side quests include: MONEY! and XP! and.... well thats about it apart from some karma which again, seems pretty pointless. \n\nThe graphics in the game are beautiful flying around and using the glider suit are fun. I haven't expeirenced too many bugs apart from being unable to loot some corpses because they're next to walls. Controller and mouse work fine for me.\n\nI feel its all a bit meh. There is no reason for your guy helping the people there even if his parents were from there. You the player have no idea why the dude you're playing as is a badass and can shoot, skin and make syringes. WHY? HOW DID HE GET ALL THESE SKILLS!? ITS PISSIN ME OFF! Anyway, overall not a bad game but I keep finding that I have to push myself to play in the hope that it will get better. Its not addictive or something that im that excited to play, it just.. is.\n\nI would wait until a price drop it you want to try it out. There is probably 60$ worth of content here, the question is is it fun enough\n\nEDIT: So i just completed the game and the story did get a lot better. Do i recommend it? Hard to say. There are some really cool things and some really not. \n\nThe Shangri-La Quests are awesome ( I wont spoil too much) they could make a game on that place alone.\n\nThe Gameplay also gets better when the enemies get more difficult and you get more of the takedown skills, syringes etc.\n\nHowever, I still find that the 2 mission characters Anita and Sabal are complete fucking retards. The game tries too hard to push difficult decisions on you so you get the feels. But in reality it only serves to piss you off.

Long review: I really enjoyed FC3 so when it started looking like FC4 was going to be that but more and more polished, I was stoked.  It really is FC3 + More.  There's more variety to the environment, for starters.  FC3 was gorgeous, but if you've seen one jungle next to a beach you've seen pretty much all of them.  Kyrat offers snowy mountain peaks, lush valleys, sweeping rivers, and more.  There's more variety to the missions too!  Sure you've got the standard tower climbing, outpost raiding, hunting missions, but now there's also rescue ops, phtography missions, and others too.  There's more weapons, more vehicles (getting in the buzzer and dropping grenades on guys below like the world's biggest seagull with the worst case of explosive diarrhea is great fun), and more collectibles.  There's also the concept of verticality, which FC3 sort of lacked.  Using your grapple and the buzzer to get around and go up and down really makes the world seem bigger and opens up some interesting new routes.

On the story front, while I haven't finished it yet, the story is also shaping up as an improvement.  I was never a huge fan of Jason Brody, generic Bro-Dude de jour, and how he saved all the magic brown people.  It felt awkward and clunky and forced and...y'know...racist.  Ajay Ghale, being from Kyrat and having personal ties to the villain automatically makes me feel much more invested in whats going on.  Characters remind you of what your father wanted, why your mother fled, and Pagan Min (voiced by Troy Baker to perfection) is so wonderfully creepy because he can get at you on that personal level.  The dual-path choices for the major story missions are a nice touch as well, and inject some replayability into the game as well as making it feel like you're making a difference in Kyrat, good or bad.  Also, unlike Vaas, it looks like Pagan Min is in it until the end, something FC3 stumbled on, showing you their strongest villain up front and then ditching him halfway through the game in exchange for Hoyt, who was about as forgettable as they come.  

If I had to point out some faults, I'd say that FC4 feels more like an elaborate, well-crafted expansion than a true sequel.   Going to an outpost, marking the badguys, then sniping them or letting a tiger loose feels exactly the same as it did in FC3.  There's no real big game-changer or anything like that.  Also, it seems to be repeating some of the missions from FC3 verbatim, like setting fire to drug fields.  Which is fine.  FC3 was great.

Basically, it's Far Cry 3, again, tying up loose ends. Now, i'm not saying its bad. I love it so far.
They have definately put the wingsuit to good use. On several occasions, i've flown into an outpost, sniped everyone with my bow, and hopped off the other edge to wingsuit, the entire time spent thinking about how badass that looked.

The grappling hook is useful, but there are limited places to use it. On certain missions they'll throw in a segment where you use it several times in a row, during which I usually Spiderman between them.

When I went back to singleplayer, I did not get any of the unlocks, and had to recapture all of them myself. Albeit it was not difficult (Except for Solo-ing a fortress, that is) it was simply annoying. It probably told me that side missions did not save, but, its Far Cry.

12999887,76561198023208567,"Day One Review

Gameplay: It's definitley Farcry, it's loyal to past gameplays while attempting to build on it. However there is a terrible lack of new innovation in the gameplay mechanics, the only major ones being the flight suit, and the grappling hook. Being able to climb in certain areas is interesting, but it feels more like the traditional concept of ledges instead of Wow I Just Climbed a Cliff. So while gameplay remains loyal to Farcry, it remains almost to loyal, and lacks any major changes. They also recycled Radio towers and Outposts from farcry 3, which add familar mechanics, but offer little in the realm of new challenges and modes. 
7/10

Graphics: It's very well done graphically, not stunning photo realism or anything, but it isn't horribly glitchy or poorly optimized (LOOKING AT YOU ASSASSIN'S CREED UNITY). The game does a fairly good job of seemlessly rendering in additional detail as you get nearer to an object and slowly becoming less detailed and distinct when you back away which is a refreshing relief from the concerns I had after the Unity rendering made it seem like an seemless distance rendering was just gone from Ubisoft games. But Unity is a different review... The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but they are well done, remain very Far Cryish in their style, and are nice enough to just look at.
9/10

Enviroment: This is where the game really set itself apart. The enviroment is shockingly unique, from mountain paths, to long forgotten statues deep in the mountains. From bears fighting each other, to eagles swooping down out of the sky and picking up small goats (Which I just saw, it was quite amazing, very realistic.) The enviroment is incredibly fun to be in. You can be driving on a road which has had ground along side it for miles, then take a left and suddenly drive off a cliff. The enviroment has beautiful changes, snow, waterfalls, rivers, small temples nestled in mountains, wild animals (all but a few which seem to want to kill you). It's gorgeous. No better way of putting it. 
10/10 

Story: This is by far the weakest part of the game. The story is sort of recycled, much like the gameplay, from the previous Farcry. Instead of being on vacation, SPOILERS, you have traveled there to spread your mother's ashes, her last wish. Naturally you are kidnapped by an insane dictator, and thrust into a civil war, between rebel groups fighting for ""Freedom"" and the insane government of sociopaths. I haven't gotten far into the story yet, simply because it has interested me. Your character, unlike the previous main character in Far Cry 3, doesn't go through any sort of struggle becoming who he is, a warrior, a killer, a soldier, whatever you want to call him. He simply picks up a gun and becomes a super soldier for the Rebel group. There is no plot behind this, no explantion, no training. You just grab that gun and start going bonkers. Soo yeah. The character lacks development, especially early on, and so do a few of the side characters. The most interesting two characters are a priest who deals weapons (Awesome guy) and a woman who you will see quite often. Well the ""president"" is interesting too, in a psychopath sort of way. 
5/10

Summary: 
The game has its' ups and its' downs. Like every game...Good graphics and a beautiful unique enviroment are hampered by recycled game mechanics and stories. Overall I would reccomend this game, but only if you are in it for wandering around, discovering things and chausing a general ruckus in a foreign land FarCry style.

Being able to climb in certain areas is interesting, but it feels more like the traditional concept of ledges instead of Wow I Just Climbed a Cliff. So while gameplay remains loyal to Farcry, it remains almost to loyal, and lacks any major changes. They also recycled Radio towers and Outposts from farcry 3, which add familar mechanics, but offer little in the realm of new challenges and modes. \n7/10\n\nGraphics: It's very well done graphically, not stunning photo realism or anything, but it isn't horribly glitchy or poorly optimized (LOOKING AT YOU ASSASSIN'S CREED UNITY). The game does a fairly good job of seemlessly rendering in additional detail as you get nearer to an object and slowly becoming less detailed and distinct when you back away which is a refreshing relief from the concerns I had after the Unity rendering made it seem like an seemless distance rendering was just gone from Ubisoft games. But Unity is a different review... The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but they are well done, remain very Far Cryish in their style, and are nice enough to just look at.\n9/10\n\nEnviroment: This is where the game really set itself apart. The enviroment is shockingly unique, from mountain paths, to long forgotten statues deep in the mountains. From bears fighting each other, to eagles swooping down out of the sky and picking up small goats (Which I just saw, it was quite amazing, very realistic.) The enviroment is incredibly fun to be in. You can be driving on a road which has had ground along side it for miles, then take a left and suddenly drive off a cliff. The enviroment has beautiful changes, snow, waterfalls, rivers, small temples nestled in mountains, wild animals (all but a few which seem to want to kill you). It's gorgeous. No better way of putting it. \n10/10 \n\nStory: This is by far the weakest part of the game. The story is sort of recycled, much like the gameplay, from the previous Farcry. Instead of being on vacation, SPOILERS, you have traveled there to spread your mother's ashes, her last wish. Naturally you are kidnapped by an insane dictator, and thrust into a civil war, between rebel groups fighting for \""Freedom\"" and the insane government of sociopaths. I haven't gotten far into the story yet, simply because it has interested me. Your character, unlike the previous main character in Far Cry 3, doesn't go through any sort of struggle becoming who he is, a warrior, a killer, a soldier, whatever you want to call him. He simply picks up a gun and becomes a super soldier for the Rebel group. There is no plot behind this, no explantion, no training. You just grab that gun and start going bonkers. Soo yeah. The character lacks development, especially early on, and so do a few of the side characters. The most interesting two characters are a priest who deals weapons (Awesome guy) and a woman who you will see quite often. Well the \""president\"" is interesting too, in a psychopath sort of way. \n5/10\n\nSummary: \nThe game has its' ups and its' downs. Like every game...Good graphics and a beautiful unique enviroment are hampered by recycled game mechanics and stories. Overall I would reccomend this game, but only if you are in it for wandering around, discovering things and chausing a general ruckus in a foreign land FarCry style. \n\n"", ""timestamp_created"": 1416359040, ""timestamp_updated"": 1416359040, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 1, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.502487540245056152"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

I plays almost exactly like Far Cry 3. Enemy AI is the same, behaves the same. Not bad, not innovative. Just more of the same.
I felt the story was weak, and it made a weak attempt at choice for the main story. It's more of an illusion of ""choice"" because nothing else is different in the world, no impact is made or felt. It was ""choose mission A or B""; that's it, just a different mission. Whoopdie-freakin-doo! *sigh* I expected more from it.

Great additions to the game:
-The ""buzzer"" is a mini helicopter; flying around in it is awesome!
-""Fortresses"" are beefed up super outposts, which are fun to take out. It's a shame there's only four of them.
-""Shangri-La"" is a drug induced/mythical soul seaching trip that is the equivalent of ""Far Cry meets Dragon Ball Z"" in a cool, good way. By the third Shangri-La ""trip"" it's freaking awesome. But there's only five or six ""trips"".
- Highjacking moving vehicles is okay.
- Shooting mortars is FUN.

12997745,76561198040675596,"Pros:
+ Awesome new weapons
+ Improved stealth options
+ Interesting story with multiple choices and outcomes (replay value)
+ Improve hunting and skinning
+ New features such as grappling hook and autodrive add a bit more diversity
+ Characters and plot are very intriguing and engaging
+ Runs smooth with no crashes (Alienware 14 LAPTOP running it on Very High at 45fps)
+ A tonne of content, such as side missions, collectibles, upgrades and skills, customisation, quests and missions, and the ability to ignor the campaign for hours should you so wish.


Cons:
- Very similar to Far Cry 3
- Difficulty spikes
- Menus are a little less smooth
- Difficulty in traversing things like mountains makes for tedium to walk around them
- Unbalanced in parts (Honey badgers are way overpowerd, taking at least 5 shots from a pistol to kill them; things like Dhole and Pigs are much the same)


Overall:
Far Cry 3 with a different (and better) story, a bunch of new weapons, much better graphics, and an overall ""smoother"" feel to the game with added realism in hunting and skinning. Stealth is more of an option now, and you actually care about th chaacters. Same core mechanics as Far Cry 3, but with a lot of major renovations. The world is MASSIVE too, once you break into Northern Kyrat. Grappling hook, more vehicles, and the scale of the world gives it the feel of a sort of Just Cause-Far Cry hybrid. Which, needless to say, is pretty bada$$.

Old review below! no need to read... but left it in for reference: 
Please read before you buy! Expensive game, expensive pain....

I've played for about 5 - 6 hours now. I have to say it is better than I first expected. The game is super awesome! It is a lot like far cry 3 like people are saying. Not that it is a bad thing. there's still a ton of new features and fun things to do. Characters are great and interesting and the world look awesome! The animals are way more lethal now and how many uses. both for you and the enemies. 

But... why the hell would you not recomend it OP? 

Good question random gamer. 

I can not recomend this game to anyone at this state. The main reason is the microstutter and mouse acceleration. The in-game options have mouseacceleration turned off yet the game still have it enabled. It is super anoying to aim and the mouse controlls just feels inconsistent and sluggish. Far cry 3 had a little bit of this but not nearly as bad. Raw mouse input would solve this probably... GET ON IT UBISOFT! 

The other thing is the stuttering. I have a GTX 980 and my fps are as high as you would expect them to be. However, despite the high fps the game lags. I am pretty sure it is some kind of in-engine lag. 

So do not expect a true smooth pc experience with this game. I hope Ubisoft listens (as they never do) and fixes these problems asap. Until then i can not recomend this game.",1416343775,1418010142,0,0.6294637322425842,2161,1127,1428605055,"{""recommendationid"": ""12997701"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198006813465"", ""num_games_owned"": 673, ""num_reviews"": 79, ""playtime_forever"": 2161, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1127, ""last_played"": 1428605055}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""EDIT: A lot was fixed when the driver arrived.

In short, if you liked Far Cry 3, you'll love Far Cry 4. They kept all the greatness of Far Cry 3 and expanded on it, making an even bigger world to explore and adding some new cool mechanics such as the grappling hook. I've yet to encounter any bugs in my first three hours, and the graphics are incredibly beautiful.

Single Player is very similar to Far Cry 3. Of course, all new things just as shooting from car is awesome, but it still feels like missing something. Im playing it on hard difficulty and it still seems too easy and the combat is pretty easy too.
Cinematics in this game is just amazing and combat looks just awesome. 
Map is quite big and allot of things to do.
Story is quite boring. Beginning was epic but the plot is too pretictable. Story is little too ""clichey"".

Multiplayer for now is total crap. Of course, we have to wait till allot of epic cool maps comes out but the co-op is quite fun.

Minor bugs but game is still amazing.

10/10 - Would beat Far Cry 4 in 20 minutes again.

Many of you might be wondering, ""How exactly does this review help me decide whether or not to buy the game?"". And that's completely understandable. I'll be the first to admit: At a glance, this review looks like a troll review. You might be sick of troll reviews. It just so happens (at the time of this writing) that it looks like 43% of you are sick of troll reviews. It even looks like one of you decided to look at the rest of my reviews and vote them all down. Well, it may come as a surprise to you, but this review isn't a troll review. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's one of those 10/10 posts without substantial reasoning. Yes, it looks like it's trying to be funny. Hell, it might even actually be funny to you. However trollish it looks, those came as afterthoughts to this review. This review was, first and foremost, about letting people know about the alternate ending where Pagan Min doesn't become the bad guy and you don't even need to fire a shot. This review is about letting people know that this game tells two sides of the Far Cry 4 story. This review is about letting people know that the psychotic dictator in fabulous pink clothing, who stabbed two different people within 10 minutes of the start of the game, really, truly, might not be as bad as the Golden Path storyline wants you to believe.

This review doesn't just say ""Pagan Min told me he'd come back in 15 minutes. He did. Turns out he's a pretty cool guy.

10/10 - Would beat Far Cry 4 in 20 minutes again.""

If you read between the lines and then follow through, this review actually says ""There are two sides to this story.

One where Min is your friend who genuinely intends to help you, where you can live in blissful semi-ignorance of the scale of the rebellion happening around you. He just desperately wants revenge on the golden path for killing his daughter. 

The other, where you take up arms and rebel against Min and his Army to finish your father's job and free kyrat from his regime.""

And that's completely understandable. I'll be the first to admit: At a glance, this review looks like a troll review. You might be sick of troll reviews. It just so happens (at the time of this writing) that it looks like 43% of you are sick of troll reviews. It even looks like one of you decided to look at the rest of my reviews and vote them all down. Well, it may come as a surprise to you, but this review isn't a troll review. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's one of those 10/10 posts without substantial reasoning. Yes, it looks like it's trying to be funny. Hell, it might even actually be funny to you. However trollish it looks, those came as afterthoughts to this review. This review was, first and foremost, about letting people know about the alternate ending where Pagan Min doesn't become the bad guy and you don't even need to fire a shot. This review is about letting people know that this game tells two sides of the Far Cry 4 story. This review is about letting people know that the psychotic dictator in fabulous pink clothing, who stabbed two different people within 10 minutes of the start of the game, really, truly, might not be as bad as the Golden Path storyline wants you to believe.\n\nThis review doesn't just say \""Pagan Min told me he'd come back in 15 minutes. He did. Turns out he's a pretty cool guy.\n\n10/10 - Would beat Far Cry 4 in 20 minutes again.\""\n\nIf you read between the lines and then follow through, this review actually says \""There are two sides to this story.\n\nOne where Min is your friend who genuinely intends to help you, where you can live in blissful semi-ignorance of the scale of the rebellion happening around you. He just desperately wants revenge on the golden path for killing his daughter. \n\nThe other, where you take up arms and rebel against Min and his Army to finish your father's job and free kyrat from his regime.\""\n\nI almost take it as a compliment that the meaning of this review was hidden so deep behind a troll facade that 43% of you thought it was a legitimate troll.

Far Cry 3 with Bees and Elephants. It's a real kick to take out an outpost with just an elephant, but so far it really plays like it's predecessor. Every FC so far has always kicked it up a significant notch. Not this one so far - except for the Bees and Elephants.


ACT II
Dang, Elephants are cool. 
If you are using your Uplay points and get the music, you might be a little disappointed. It implied one got the OST, but you really only get one song at two minutes and fourty seconds. Felt like a bit of a rip-off. Still have elephant enjoyment.

Afterthoughts: 
 Steam achievements would have been nice also. They never claimed they did so I shouldn't whine like some old cranky elephant, but there you have it.
 I was play FC2 just before this (no towers to speak of there) and really miss the F5/F9 save restore.
 Where the heck are the Yaks?
 Why can't I travel the whole map (out of bounds errors) until later in the campaitgn? Seems kind of arbitrary.
 I only hate dying because it takes so long to load again.
 Why are 1/6 of the trees 2D?  Just saying ...

12995094,76561198054408857,"Much like FarCry3, but that doesn't stop this game from being absolutely awesome.
+There's so much more to do in this game than any other open world game I've ever seen.
+You can do missions in your totally own way, no need to follow guidelines.
+The graphics are absolutely stunning on any of the high settings.
+There's a nice storyline which is incredible long, fun and incredible.
+You can travel everywhere between the mountains, and play with everything you can see.
+Includes a great map editor which is easy to use, even for first-timers.
+All of that FarCry goodness which you've seen before (=rare animals etc!)
+Nicely working Co-op/multiplayer gamemodes and freeroaming with friends is pretty darn awesome!

-The motives for important missions are a little non-existing.
-There is a bug which almost everyone has where one of the cores is running on 100% some of the 
time, resulting in stuttering problems.
-AI is incredible dumb, even on hardest mode.
-Too many animals attacking your ass at all times. Same goes for enemy AI.
-Some of the guns are the exact same that were used in Fc3.

In my opinion this game would be amazingly perfect if they patched the bugs n' glitches and listened to the community a little more, which they probably will, but for now you may want to wait and see.

flickering
- If AA is enabled then I get an enormous flickering on SLI.
=> Some issues solved, not all

dark shadows, black night while playing on SLI 
- on Far Cry 3 settings, the dark shadow is gone, but flickering is coming up equaless of AA setting

random crashes
- Game crashes randomly on same spot. Like first outpost to liberate (30 crashes on same message when near the outpost), needed to make annother mission first, then the outpost to suceed.

Shortcut for overjump cutscene videos
- as there is always in front of the video an autosave, after restart, the cutscene runs again. :/ Very funny to see 10 times the same video.

FOV Setting missing in SLI
- Please make the FOV slider work with Nvidia Surround and Eyefinity too.

Black starting screen
- fix USB devices like G13

Not a fan. For a game that wasnt meant to be a port, sure does feel like one. Not sure why it's so hard to get the basics like mouse acceleration and basic smooth frame rates right. Pretty sure I watched the non-skippable 5 minute intro about 10 times. Thanks for that. Thanks also for having to install U-Play. I don't want it and I don't need it. Maybe you should just keep it? The story is weak so far, as is the action, I've set it to 'hard', but maybe it should read 'boring'. At this stage, not much inclination to keep playing. As they say, don't throw good money after bad, and time is money. My $75 is gone and it's not coming back. Should I bother spending more time?

12993589,76561198033980648,"So far so good. Game looks great and plays great (didn't even have the new driver installed and it played fine). Haven't played enough to get a real review on it but I just wanted to put out that it plays fine. Troy Baker has an amazing voice, not exactly the person I thought would do the voice of Pagan Min but hey it worked out in the end. Mouse sensitivity was a bit odd but I was able to change and now it fits me better. The, I forget what it is called so I will just call it this, mouse tagging was also a bit odd but I turned it off so now it is fine. Overall it is pretty good so far.

EDIT: OK, just beat the game and I have to say it is still good. I guess I will start off with the story.
Story: Not the best story I have ever heard but not the worst. Had to play as the voice of reason at times between the bickering children and they often got their feelings hurt. A lot of times the story didn't make sense, you come to Kyrat and suddenly you are the greatest warrior that ever lived. Far Cry 3 was similar in that aspect but they had the Tatau so it made up for it meanwhile Far Cry 4 doesn't. The story is important but not too important in a free roam game.

Gameplay: It plays like Far Cry 3 so if you liked Far Cry 3 gameplay then you will most likely like this one as well. They added a few new things that Far Cry 3 didn't have like Grappling Hooks, Beehives, etc. but for the most part it is just like Far Cry 3. Belltowers to climb in order to reveal the map and to get free weapons. Sneak in to take down an outpost, charge head on and take everyone out or just put down everyone from a distance. My favorite thing to do is come in with a Buzzer and a grenade launcher as my secondary and rain hell from above. Cars act pretty much the same, but they added a new feature where you can shoot from the car instead of getting out and shooting them it also has an auto drive feature so you can shoot without worrying about slamming into a tree. New Karma system which allows you access new perks and other things. You can also call in gunmen to help you out.

Location: It's alright but this might be a bit biased since I like city settings not forest/jungle settings. Lots of interesting places to visit with their own little theme. Kyrat is a large and open place to explore so it will be hard to get bored. The Himalayas is pretty fun to visit. They added snowstorms so you have to find oxygen tanks in order to stay alive. It also makes it harder to see and harder for the enemies to see you so you get a boost in your stealth. Haven't explored it too much so I haven't found everything up there.

Replayability: It has a lot of replayability. This game has a good amount of choices on what you should do. Side with this person and get this mission or side with that person and get that mission. I have only beaten it once so I haven't been able to see what all the different decisions will do but I plan on playing it several times in order to see what all the choices do.

Characters: MC isn't my favorite but not my least favorite. He comes off very awkwardly and bland. Don't really like the leaders of the Golden Path, one of them is stuck in tradition meanwhile the other wants to destroy it and move on often dragging you into their little spats. Hell I liked the villains more than the ""good guys"". Noore and Paul made me feel bad, Yuma made me feel pitty but the ""good guys"" made me feel nothing really, couldn't care less if they lived or died (except Bhadra, felt bad for her). Pagan Min, 7 words: best video game villian in my opinion. He beats Vaas in my opinion, dude is a riot. Couldn't stop laughing at the end and having Troy (Fucking) Baker as his voice actor is the cherry on top.

Wildlife: Eagles are assholes, straight up jerks. ""Oh you minding your own business, just walking around? Caw caw motherfucker."" A lot of the predators act the same as they do in Far Cry 3. Rhinos are rude, Elephants are pretty chill and riding them is fun. Terrified of swimming due to the Demon Fish and Honey Badgers are made of steel. Everything else just runs away like normal.

Weapons: A lot of Far Cry 3 weapons make a return and the weapon wheel is pretty similar except now you can't have 4 rocket launchers, only 3. You have to have a secondary which can be a pistol of choice, a sawed off shotgun, a crossbow or a grenade launcher. You can use your secondary in vehicles to avoid getting out to kill people. New throwing knife so you can take people down silently without a bow (or 360 headshot someone across the map). Grenade launcher mounted weapons and mortars which destroys everything in the way (I wasn't expecting that the first time I shot that thing). Attachments aren't really special, for example silencers, sights and extended mags. You can also give your weapon a new paint job just like in Far Cry 3.

TLDR: Game plays like Far Cry 3 so it is a lot of fun for me. Story is alright, not the greatest. ""Good guy"" characters suck, villains rule. Location is fine, but I am a bit biased on that. Wildlife is rude most of the time but they can be pretty cool. Far Cry 4 has the same weapons as Far Cry 3 but also has some of its own weapons. Also forgot to mention the game continues after you beat it so you don't have to worry about stopping before the last mission in order to continue playing.",1416321233,1416523410,1,0.4986666440963745,6246,2018,1590437489,"{""recommendationid"": ""12993589"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198033980648"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 1, ""playtime_forever"": 6246, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 2018, ""last_played"": 1590437489}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""So far so good.

Pros
+Co Op
+Dynamic Skill Trees (Tiger vs Elephant)
+FUR!!!
+Lush Envirnoment with active foliage cover system. Everything has collision detection!
+Animals are alive. Watched an Eagle snatch a dog than drop it on a rock to kill it. A Leopard ran down a Shyrpa knocked him over, held him by the kneck then starred and growled at me as I passed by. Then it slowly dragged its victim away into the bushes!
+Rock Climbing
+Bait! (Lure animals to attack enemies)
+Interesting Characters and Story
+Branching Main Mission with alternate out comes.
+Guns, Bows, Explosives and Knife play all done perfectly.
+Did I mention FUR!!!
+Died to a Rhino, Leopard, Snake, Tiger, Demon Fish and an Eagle... but Honey Badger dont care!
+Used an Elephant to Knock a convoy off of a cliff.
+Flew map of the earth in my Wing Suite.....and died to a tree when i sneezed!
+Landed my personal gyrocopter on the back of a moving enemy transport truck. Planted C4, then flew away. Followed from a distance and waited untill it drove into an outpost. Click..... Big Badda Boom!

Cons
-Minor Texture, Lighting and Volumetric fog issues (but this is typical till Nvidia gets an optimized driver out) ***Update: Driver was released and the game looks stunning. Volumetric fog rolls in over the hills. Sun shining throught the trees and water. Game is simply Beautiful.
-Mouse / Gamepad sensitivity issues (See quick fix below).

4/5 Stars..holding one in reserve till I experience more of the game.

Everything from the skill levelling through to liberating outposts and even switching towers to reveal the map, are all present and correct. So does that mean it's just a big, fat con and totally not worth the money?

Well... no. I love the Far Cry series and 3 was brilliant. That Ubisoft have pretty much shrugged and said 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' is entirely understandable. That they charge full price for it is kind of a low blow, but it's still worth every penny. The game plays smoothly (had to knock graphics down from high to make it smoother on my very mid-range PC) and there is some scenery pop-up, but the game is still beautiful. You get to the top of a peak, survey the land from your feet to the horizon and can go anywhere, anytime, in anything, for any reason. Get bored with the main story? Do a side quest. Get bored with the side quests? Take an outpost and then reset it (nice!) to do it better. Bored with that and want to drive a truck off a cliff, bail out as it plummets, deploy your wingsuit, fly down above an outpost, pull the parachute and drift to the ground taking potshots at the guards with your pistol? Yep, you can do that too.

In addition, the core gameplay has a few more bells and whistles too. Auto-drive allows you to sit back and relax, take in the views and all that good stuff while the games does the driving. It'll also take the wheel while you focus on shooting. Few things more satisfying than haring off in hot pursuit of someone, getting close and flicking to autodrive while you wait for the perfect head-shot. 
Also worth a mention is the gyro-copter which is just so much fun to zip around in, as well as the rippling wave of explosions from firing a mortar, the far less gullible AI and charging around on elephant because, well, why not?

It's just FC3 with another 10-20% of 'stuff' thrown into the mix, but on every level of the game. Vehicles, enemies, weapons, missions, side-quests, story, Hurk, places, people, plot and on and on. Evolution not revolution is the order of the day here and I'm glad of it. Add in the 'worth the price of admission alone' map-maker (I've spent hours just playing around in that on past FC games) and there's arguably way more value in this than Call of Duty: Rinse & Repeat 7 or whatever.

12992275,76561197980444243,"Best game of 2014

This was a hesitant purchase after the cluster that was assassins creed unity, my faith in Ubisoft had dropped to an alltime low.  Then Ubisoft redeemed itself with Far Cry 4.  
The Good----

-Zero Technical Issues (great FPS/Graphics) running on very high with a slightly above average PC
-Beautiful Graphics combined with beautiful setting.
-Embraces the ""Do it your way"" mentality allowing gamers to play how they find the game fun to to play
-New additions to traditional Far Cry mechanics do not feel gimmiky (Grapping rope climbing and mountain climbing actually fun? never thought i would say that after so many years of holding a button to climb..glances at assassins creed)
-All the menial tasks typical of Ubisoft Games (Hunting, Liberating outpost, ETC) feel challenging and Unique rather than repetitive and annoying (looking at you Assassins Creed)
-Larger Map, More Random things to do (that are actually fun) distracting me from main missions,
-COOP is an absolute blast, and actually works.
-Enemy NPC's and Wildlife are deadly, Hunting Honey Badgers has led to me running for my life
-Expanded Weapon and Vehicle Arsenal allowing numerous more methods of destroying your enemy

The Less than Good (but still not bad)---

-The Skill Tree, Is rather small and while each of the upgrades is significant, it does not take long to acquire skills
-Climbing Towers to gain access to the visiable area map.   I am personally tired of this mechanic from Ubisoft and find it tedious and silly after so many years of climbing something in their games just to see whats in the area, roll the dice try something new.

I would recommend this game. Lets hit the basics:
Graphics are demanding but outstanding.
Sound, well once you turn off the music you can hear a bit more. But overall good so far.
Storyline is there and slowly unfolding as I play, not too fast and doesnt feel like it will take forever to complete.
AI is very well. I shoot a guy throwing a molotov and he bursts into flames. They seem very dedicated at following you and trying to catch you on fire.
World is open world and I have caught myself saying, man thats cool a few times. When you jump into your vehicle and follow a person that out of know where gets rammed by a rhino....thats part of the cool factor you look for.
And how about this, since they allow you to fire from your vehicle with sidearms they have coded in a autopilot for most the roads. So you can focus on the gas pedal and the trigger. Easily to turn on and off.

Are there bugs? Yes. Over populated with them? No. 
This game is playable and enjoyable.

12991043,76561197998280950,"Well... I really hate to say it, but I'm actually  disappointed by Far Cry 4 so far. 

About 8 hours of gameplay in since release (3 on steam, 5 on uplay last night offline mode). 

I pre-ordered it with high hopes from the trailers.
(given that so far this is my experience in the amount of time I've played so far as shown by the hour count in the top of the review.)

Things that are the same from Far Cry 3:
-Weapons progession the same so far, look the same and sound the same
-The quests to recapture cell towers, complete with rickety and broken sections down to the same ropes to jump-climb to. Even the exact same zip lining to the ground and the zoom to the 3 different areas around each tower.
-Trash looting and selling is the same
-Skinning has the exact same animation 
-Collecting plants has the exact same animation
-Healing yourself is the exact same in function and very close to the original animation
-Hang gliders are the exact same in function and model
-Outposts. Right down to the alarms. 
-Fire extinguishing animation

Things that are new so far:
-Grappling hook that can only be used in certain places
-Setting destinations on the map shows the roads to take to get there in your minimap as well as on the road itself
-Auto drive so you can shoot while driving (also functions as fast travel, although I hit cars in the road while using it)
-Different skill tree
-Bait to bring wild animals to bear (no pun intended) on enemies
-New mission style at major intersections - ""choose your path"" which affects your gameplay
-New enemy ""hunters"" can charm animals and use them to attack you
-Throwing knives and riding elephants into fights

Honestly, I feel like this is more of an expansion than a new game in and of itself. The initial trailer had me excited but now that I've gotten into it...it's more of the same. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I loved Far Cry 3 for the story and the mechanics. I just wish it wasn't so re-hashed so far. 

Without really wanting to get into spoilers, you get thrown into the action (once again a tourist in a foreign place with a seemingly insane person) only this time...you're just bringing your mother's ashes to a place. You're not kidnapped and forced to run for your life and survive - everyone knows who you are and you're just a tourist. There's no story motivation to skin animals or collect plants like there was in Far Cry 3 - you're just some random guy who even makes the same noises when doing so. The psychological effect of watching Jason from the last one go from scared and weak to eventually being able to do complicated takedowns and becoming less affected when skinning animals was fantastic. With Far Cry 4...you are a tourist who is trying to deliver his mom's ashes. And incidentally you are a great shot and know exactly what to do with plants (harvesting with the same animation) and taking skins after killing animals (with the same animation). The main character feels bland and un-interesting, down to his voice lines. 

The whole basis of the plot (3 or so hours in, this may or may not change) for your character is that you're some guy's son. Really. And for some reason everyone knows it even though you're just coming back to Kyrat. That's the basis of your abilities and your fame. 

In FC3 you earned that feeling, people saw you as a skinny white guy until you got the tatau and everyone knew what you had done and how much of a badass you'd become. Vaas even let you go because he didn't think you were a threat. Even your friends realized it later and were frankly scared by it. The sequence in FC3 where you were driving away, telling Liza to serpentine while grenading vehicles behind you and actually laughing out loud - that's the point at which the player realizes he really has changed. That kind of immersion in which you kill the first guy with the knife after he tries stabbing you and going ""oh crap, oh crap"" then proceeding to run shows the character's flaws and how blatantly unprepared he is for dealing with getting his friends back. He was nervous about even shooting a pistol in the beginning.

In FC4 it's another guy who has no...development? He can shoot guns, he can loot plants, he can skin animals but there's no motivation for it. He's just...there. In the middle of a war, trying to get his mom's ashes to a place. And for some reason isn't shocked there's a war going on, but instead says ""i'll help you guys out"" and runs around the island probably with his mom in his backpack.

I'll update later as I play through. It's not a terrible thing that it's a lot of the same...but I don't think it's worth 60 bucks as an entirely new game.

Again, this is all -so far- so players can get an idea of the amount of time I've played vs what I've seen. Thanks for reading, feel free to share your ideas.

-Interesting story line in Kyrat.
-Large map. many new things to discover compairs to FC3.
-PAGAN MIN SO COOL!!
-More cool weaponries and items to use.
-More skills to upgrade.
-Graphics improvements, beuitiful view of Kyrat looks lot more gorgeous than FC3.
-More different choices could been made by players in the main storyline. Completely changes the story on how you choose your path.
-New COOP mode for campaign. Now you can play the story with one of your friend.

Cons and could be changed in the future
-Horrible mouse lag on PC. There are some ways to decrease them, but don't think currently people can compeletly get rid of them.
-Plays little bit too much like FC3. Hunting and skinning animals, gathering leaves and taking down enemys stealthly. Maybe it's only because Im just started playing.
-Main character's voice acting and lines are bit boring... Only in my opinion though.

Other than some of the low perfermances currently on PC, it's a great game for people who loves sandbox and open-world FPS games. Definitely worth a buy. It also don't requires a godly PC like Assassin's Creed: Unity, my 660ti can run medium to high with around 40-60 fps no problem. Havn't tried the multiplayer yet, don't know how it will perform.

It's like FarCry 3 with a new cool villain and a really great big new world to explore.
Pagan Min is a really good villain just like Vaas (but not better). 

Kyrat is a great place where you can ride an elephant and crush your enemies.
Great tourist place.
Beautiful game with epic and awesome moments !

60fps on ultra with really rare drops to 30fps.

Smooth gameplay, good models, beautiful scenery, ambient sounds.. it's a lot of fun.  I'm really enjoying just walking around doing my own thing, discovering locations just by chance, with my bow and arrow ready to take down any wild animals I come across.  

Lots of interface options too, so you can remove the minimap and other helpers, and take off auto tagging when u aim a weapon at a bad guy to make the experience more immerseful.

Well, im sure there's a bunch of professional indepth reviews coming to help you decide whether or not to buy it, but if u loved FC3, then u'll love this too!

I haven't come across any major bugs yet, I have the graphics on ultra and occasionally get some sort of flickering effect now and then, but nothing to dampen the enjoyment of playing..

*update!*
This flickering effect appears to be some sort of tree glitch, where trees are changing between a detailed 3D model to a 2D model rapidly, and this has been solved by updating nVidia driver to 344.75 :)

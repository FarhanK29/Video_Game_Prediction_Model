In contrast to the majority view, I enjoyed this game thoroughly! Although I do agree that this is not a ""true"" Mafia game in spirit, I would treat this as a fun GTA clone set in the 60s, and that's what it is! [b]The developers spared no expense as far as modern graphics, realistic facial animations and stellar voice acting go, and that made the whole gameplay experience feel cinematic.[/b] The cinematic experience turned out to be a great incentive to run through the repetitive mission design, which I admit is something that left a lot to be desired!

To elaborate on cinematic gameplay, I would like to point out the attention to detail put to each car model that drives like it should in a game world. I am sure not many are real fans of the driving in the game, but I enjoyed driving the Exotic Vehicles that have really smooth handling! [b]As far as the action goes, the combat mechanics feel tight![/b] The feedback you get after shooting every gun in the game feels right and the visceral satisfaction you get after a brutal takedown is intense! So no complaints there!

[b]The soundtrack of the game is replete with classics for which the Mafia series is famous for.[/b] I bet in the long run some of these songs would probably be removed like they were in the original Mafia when it re-released. Nevertheless, for the time-being, I really enjoyed driving through the game world while listening to the tracks! Speaking of the tracks, the radio advertisements are great too! It made the whole experience feel more immersive.

[b]However, the lack of post end-game activities apart from the boring delivery missions and races doesn't do much for you to keep on playing the game for hours post-completion.[/b] The DLC do add a lot of value to the overall package, but if you completed them before completing the main game, you will not have anything to do but sell weed. Speaking of the DLC, all of them are great in their own right and aren't as repetitive as the main game missions! Nevertheless, I expected the Bounty Hunting missions to be continuous and wanted Sammy's to be made playable as a business which you are supposed to protect and run like a true Mafia boss. But alas, that isn't the case.

[b]So I would certainly recommend the game for the price of admission, but however the frequent discounts certainly make it a great deal you shouldn't pass out on if you like open world games![/b]",1597479598,1597487837,1,0.5,4013,4013,1597477821,"{""recommendationid"": ""74336743"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198002804113"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 73, ""playtime_forever"": 4013, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 4013, ""last_played"": 1597477821}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""[h1]Rating: 7.5/10[/h1]\n\nIn contrast to the majority view, I enjoyed this game thoroughly!

I looked up online and saw that it was the best part of the game! Boy, was I wrong. The story was great! After a while, I actually enjoyed watching them, almost like playing a new game in my younger years when games felt more engaging. I gave this game a chance and here I am, excited to play it again, but not for a while. I saved a ton of side quests for later because I found out that there was no new game plus, or anything to do after you beat the game 100%. That's one of the things I was disappointed with. There are bugs in this game as well but that's normal for a lot of games so I won't criticize it that much. Some of the guns are fun to fire, like the m60 or that m1 garand looking one. Best part of the game for me was how the enemies would die when they got shot. They'd then lie on the ground, either dying slowly or quickly or a simple bullet to the head. Just a bit of realism I enjoyed. The mission are DEFINITELY repetitive but for me it was no problem. I watch YouTube videos and stuff while playing so no big deal.

Boy, was I wrong. The story was great! After a while, I actually enjoyed watching them, almost like playing a new game in my younger years when games felt more engaging. I gave this game a chance and here I am, excited to play it again, but not for a while. I saved a ton of side quests for later because I found out that there was no new game plus, or anything to do after you beat the game 100%. That's one of the things I was disappointed with. There are bugs in this game as well but that's normal for a lot of games so I won't criticize it that much. Some of the guns are fun to fire, like the m60 or that m1 garand looking one. Best part of the game for me was how the enemies would die when they got shot. They'd then lie on the ground, either dying slowly or quickly or a simple bullet to the head. Just a bit of realism I enjoyed. The mission are DEFINITELY repetitive but for me it was no problem. I watch YouTube videos and stuff while playing so no big deal.

I love it because I love the almost documentary like style of cut-scenes, I love this time period as my dad practically raised me on this era of music and the like And the story feels good, I like Lincoln as a character, I like the supporting cast like Donovan he's great, the exact kind of guy I'd want if I was gonna take over a city. The city looks pretty nice graphics are good all that jazz Grade A. That's not my problem.

The reason why I have problems with this game, its the controls. Lincoln's character controls are manageable but he feels clunky at times, which I can live with cos he's a big muscled army beefcake that's shredded. So finding him a bit awkward in a small space, or knocking something over or him feeling like you're driving a tank fair enough. Driving, Oh my gods the driving. I play keyboard and I haven't tried it with a controller because I'm awful with them but it feels like you're driving a rock, heavy vehicles and bad handling on every car, I've tested most of them by stealing different ones to find a good one then being chased by police so I got a good handling workout, breaking just makes  you skid all over the place and the slow-mo only helps so much. Its really a shame because I'd love to cruise around looking at the city in a beautiful recreation of classic cars.

So here's my final take. You want a really nice looking period piece game of the Vietnam era with all the music and themes to go with it some of the attention to detail is really nice, great, go for it.

Is it because the game was good? No.
I own it because I played it during a very dark time in my life. It sort of distracted me from my troubles. In a way, this game is nostalgic for only those reasons.

Is the game as bad as everyone says it is? Honestly? Yes. It's one of the most boring, mind-numbingly repetitive games on the market. If you're old enough to remember the old Prototype games, this is pretty much the mob version of that. The characters are all dull (though, the voice acting is awesome). 

I'd give anyone who has had the patience to beat this game and get all the achievements a medal. This is coming from someone who enjoys period pieces. I LOVE historical games and even then, that wasn't enough for me to like this game.

If you want a better alternative, play Yakuza 0. At first glance it looks like a weaboo game for anime-lovers but after about 30 minutes, it calms down into a mature crime story. This is coming from one of the few people who absolutely hates anime.

If you're old enough to remember the old Prototype games, this is pretty much the mob version of that. The characters are all dull (though, the voice acting is awesome). \n\nI'd give anyone who has had the patience to beat this game and get all the achievements a medal. This is coming from someone who enjoys period pieces. I LOVE historical games and even then, that wasn't enough for me to like this game.\n\nIf you want a better alternative, play Yakuza 0. At first glance it looks like a weaboo game for anime-lovers but after about 30 minutes, it calms down into a mature crime story. This is coming from one of the few people who absolutely hates anime.\n\nThe game gets a 5/10 - Average. I'd advise playing this title if you are truly bored and have nothing to do. I mean, if you have absolutely no life or if you're transitioning between jobs and have exhausted all other entertainment options, play this game.

I thought I'd feel right at home, given all the hours I put into The Godfather II on PS3. But even someone like me, who is used to redundancy and repetition in the name of mobster storytelling, is tired by Mafia III. Solid story and unique setting aside, this game has very little going for it. The unique mechanics of police response and calling in help are just not enough to make this series a proper alternative to Grand Theft Auto. 

The game controls fine. Driving works. It's no Forza, but zipping around in classic muscle cars is fun. Songs on the radio are pretty solid as well, they did their research. I feel fine 99% of the time going through this on keyboard and mouse. Gunplay feels great too. I feel much more confident flanking enemies and taking the charge here than I did back in Mafia II. Everything feels like it has weight.

But it's not enough. The game has improved since its launch, but still. It took a while to stop launching into a black screen the first few times I ran it. Ragdolls and corpses will clip through things consistently. Animations beyond Lincoln Clay himself are lacking. View distance is a joke. You'll see cars spawn in if you're driving at any decent speed. Audio will play in the pause menu, whether it's from the radio or an NPC speaking. Characters' clothes will fly around in cutscenes even if they're just sitting. Hell, only half of the cutscenes seem to use whatever custom outfit you're wearing... even though a lot of them don't seem pre-rendered? I can't imagine how it runs on other PCs.

And worse than all the jank is the gameplay loop. It wasn't enough to warrant the $60 at launch, and it's barely enough to warrant the $30 now. Even with the difficulty jacked, running all these errands to take territory is not that satisfying. At least The Godfather II kept things interesting with you defending your rackets, resulting in all-around turf wars. All you do here is balance the perks from your underbosses after giving them rackets. Tight as the mechanics might feel, they can't carry this whole campaign. The story isn't being done justice. A Netflix mini-series would've made more of an impact than this middling open-world sandbox.

Mafia III is less along the lines of Grand Theft Auto and Watch Dogs, and much more akin to Sleeping Dogs and Saints Row. That is to say, lacking. Again, catch a sale.

Edit (11/08/20) : So after completing the game and choosing a 'safer' ending for Lincoln, I would have to rate this game as between positive and negative. 
Would I recommend it?

73295039,76561198034315837,"Mafia 3 is buggy, looks relatively shoddy for how demanding it is to run and depending on area/mission unstable. This even after the game being originally released in 2016. If you just play the game without checking out any tips on how to take over rackets it's going to start to feel like a repetitive slog sooner rather than later and that hurts the narrative impact of the game relative to Mafia 2 which is a purely a story driven experience. There's plenty of good reasons behind the games rather low steam percentage score, of that there's no doubt.

But even with all those obstacles to overcome to properly get into the game it's still a Mafia game and the gameplay and driving is fundamentally solid and fun with the caveat that the enemy AI can be exploited once you get used to its quirks, then again that's true for a lot of other action shooter games. There's just too much stuff to do that can derail the Mafia game experience if you where expecting something similar to first two games, unfortunately, but once you accept the game for what it is you can still get a lot out of it especially if you take to all the different characters the game introduces to you which range from insane to mostly depressed but at least you got a level headed wiseguy like yourself in Vito (player character from the 2nd game) as one of your underbosses so that helps steady the rest of the cast. A lot of the side stuff can be fun but can be easily ignored if you just want to move to main story along.

One thing to note is the season pass dlc is actually quite good and enjoyable and gives you good story driven missions that give certain key main game NPCs further character development while providing you with different gameplay challenges, settings and mechanics relative to the main game. They also provide you with weapons, vehicles and equipment that can speed up the repetitive task of racket acquisition that is the meat of the campaign so my suggestion is to do them asap as soon as they become available.

Mafia 3 isn't for everyone but if you are a fan of the earlier games especially the 2nd one and open world GTA-likes in general it's worth a try if you can get it during a sale. It can be pretty good at its best and rather frustrating if a bug impedes your progress but I will make note that these bugs where at their worst during optional side content and not with the main content of the campaign and the dlc (though each dlc also has its own side content after the main story part concludes).

There you have it. Another flawed game that with the right slant can be pretty damn good.

There's plenty of good reasons behind the games rather low steam percentage score, of that there's no doubt.\n\nBut even with all those obstacles to overcome to properly get into the game it's still a Mafia game and the gameplay and driving is fundamentally solid and fun with the caveat that the enemy AI can be exploited once you get used to its quirks, then again that's true for a lot of other action shooter games. There's just too much stuff to do that can derail the Mafia game experience if you where expecting something similar to first two games, unfortunately, but once you accept the game for what it is you can still get a lot out of it especially if you take to all the different characters the game introduces to you which range from insane to mostly depressed but at least you got a level headed wiseguy like yourself in Vito (player character from the 2nd game) as one of your underbosses so that helps steady the rest of the cast. A lot of the side stuff can be fun but can be easily ignored if you just want to move to main story along.\n\nOne thing to note is the season pass dlc is actually quite good and enjoyable and gives you good story driven missions that give certain key main game NPCs further character development while providing you with different gameplay challenges, settings and mechanics relative to the main game. They also provide you with weapons, vehicles and equipment that can speed up the repetitive task of racket acquisition that is the meat of the campaign so my suggestion is to do them asap as soon as they become available.\n\nMafia 3 isn't for everyone but if you are a fan of the earlier games especially the 2nd one and open world GTA-likes in general it's worth a try if you can get it during a sale. It can be pretty good at its best and rather frustrating if a bug impedes your progress but I will make note that these bugs where at their worst during optional side content and not with the main content of the campaign and the dlc (though each dlc also has its own side content after the main story part concludes).\n\nThere you have it. Another flawed game that with the right slant can be pretty damn good.

18. when doing car races sometimes the car won't move, so you have to abandon mission, exit vehicle, enter vehicle, and start the mission again
19. falling with the car in the water at high speed may teleport you under the map where you endlessly fall


[h1] [b] Things I did NOT like: [/b] [/h1]

- sometimes, npc jump in front of your car when driving fast
- gameplay very repetitive
- cops pop your tire too fast
- sometimes travelling distances are wayyyy too long and feels tedious
- sometimes cars don't move when using the car horn
- boats are a bit hard to control
- use of weapons and fighting techniques are always the same
- killing bosses doesn't feel special or rewarding
- graphics could be better, character hair is oof, and facial expressions not that great compared to rivals
- sometimes the lighting can be overexposed and the whole screen is white
- NOT all cars are customizable (the ones you find on the street) and there is no way to save a car
- when doing a side mission and driving a truck, the truck sometimes becomes your main vehicle and lose the old one 
- I wished there was more exploring in the game, since the world is so big and detailed, you don't explore it much, but your travel a lot
- sometimes you have multiple objectives at once and the missions and map always leads you to the one that is the most far way, and therefore you travel and waste time
- no manual save button
-BUSHES ARE OBSTACLES, you can crash your car in them...just no

(added 02/08/2020)

- nothing left to do after game is finished
- ending not as exciting
- the island DLC was cool, but once you finish the mission, you can't go there anymore

[h1] [b] Things I did like: [/b] [/h1]

- DLCs added a refreshment (with the investigation mechanic, weed farm and car chases)
- if you buy it with the trilogy, the game is not worth much which is good money value
- the worlds are beautiful, historically accurate
- the cars are amazing and they are hard to handle, which adds a fun challenge to the game
- Races are cool, although to get 1st + you need to work on story to unlock upgrades and new cars
- Combat system is smooth and well done, nice variation of guns but I wished enemies had more variation in the guns
- Story is rich and interesting it keeps me going
-Character development is good altho relationships with other characters are not as developed ( romantic relationship with Roxy feels rushed)
- other ways to make money (weed farm) 
- different districts represent different cities of the US, therefore the environment feels extremely diverse and big
- other additions are very nice, such as outfits, car customizations
- characters are racists and n word is used a lot, brave for a game company to do, I like it
- ability to call for a car and weapon store wherever you want is awesome, so you don't have to travel to a point on the map for that
- the game is around 150 hours (including completing EVERYTHING like achievements and collectables)
- there are PlayBoy magazines, say hi to boobies 

[h1] [b] BIGGEST DOWNFALL [/b] [/h1]

- very repetitive, every mission feels the same, and the game feels more like a hitman game than a mafia game. Combat system is too simple and no new features added (unless you buy the DLCs which adds the slow-mo)


[h1] [b] BIGGEST PERK [/b] [/h1]

- the environments are beautiful and historically accurate, story is rich and in all categories the game does either fine or good, but it's never amazing


[h1] [b] CONCLUSION [/b] [/h1]

It may seem like a lot of negativity from me. For a mafia fan, this game is most likely a disappointment. If you never played a Mafia game (like me) I would give this game a go. (and since the price is cheap, you get a lot of value for your money).

Simplified evaluation below  (1 worst - 10 best)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- I loved the story, it was just excellent, well written considered for the time when the game was released - it was never 
  boring you're the good guy destroying the bad scum even though facing moral dilemas. I liked the realistic fact that even 
  the good guys included agents and the preacher do have got often also pretty biting questions and bad conscience  - 9
- the setup design of the environment (city and surroundings) just awesome  - 9
- graphics well done - loved the sharp reflections on road while driving through the rain towards a sunset - awesome, 
  considered the time when game released  it was a splendid graphics achievement  - 10
- UX, still intuitive handling even though here and there there was a slight delay in reaction in combat - 7 
- nice nearly authentic cars to drive with a solid sound  -  8 
- Bugs pretty seldom , were  ther  any  at all? Don't remember - 9 
- Sound - pretty good - 8 
- music not evaluated since for me personally plays the music in games secondary role only - instead I apprecite rather 
  game content  -  * 

This game was like,initially I just haven't expected absolutely nothing, back then. However I was excited with the time I dived in New Bordeaux.  Althoug there was probably just a bit too much of political correctness sh**  embedded in the dialogs,  but when considering those events nowadays , then maybe it was alright to rise awareness back then too indeed.

72561018,76561198137026460,"Mafia 3 is highly anticipated sequel to great and beloved Mafia 2 and with a promise of an open world, people were hoping to get less linear story telling as well as freedom to build our drug empire at our own terms. Well, we did not exactly get that. Mafia 3 is plagued by so many issues that I find it quite understandable if some people are appalled by them and do not finish the game. And I hold Hangar 13 responsible for that for if not for the mission design and structure issues, the game could have easily been the best in the series for it has several "" the best's"" in the Mafia franchise - best cutscenes and mo-cap, best shooting, best driving and ABSOLUTE best soundtrack. If only the devs decided to make it linear as the two previous games, it would have worked out so much better as the clearly do not know how to make appealing open-world game design. And that bothers me because Mafia 3 tells an incredible story about racism in the US in the 60s and to see it from Lincoln's perspective is an experience that few games have managed to achieve. All that is amplified by the best mo-cap seen to date as well as greatly executed voice acting. So overall, even though the game has myriad of problems, I can still recommend you playing it even for just wanting to experience the great story a characters the game has to offer. You just need to get through those annoying and repetitive racket missions.

Pros:
+ Game managed to capture the atmosphere of 60s USA perfectly with all its highs and lows
+ Soundtrack, soundtrack, SOUNDTRACK - only the best selection of pop/rock/jazz music of what was probably the era
+ Shooting and combat in general felt satisfying until the very end
+ Driving (as long as you have it on simulation mode)
+ Story and cutscenes reinforced by spot on voice acting 
+ Characters that can easily compete with best movies ones - Father James, Donovan the Underbosses - all played very naturally with each one of them being interesting
+ Upgrading feels rewarding enough
+ New Bordeaux with all its districts from rich folks parts to the bayou is really well crafted 
+ Attention to detail - the small things like radio crackling when in tunnel and small animations

Cons:
- Overall graphics - while animations look incredibly good, overall graphical design is lacking - even on ultra settings the game just doesnt look that good - you can either select highest antialiasing which, due to being consolist FXAA makes everything blurry or you can set it on low and not have the blur and bokeh effect but suddenly everything has jagged lines. You can not win here
- Racket missions - the main point why people dislike Mafia 3 and yes, it is very much a valid one. These mandatory side missions are completely and utterly same in all 9 Rackets and there are 2 people in each racket you need to complete these missions for which makes you doing same exact thing that got old after first racket total of 18 TIMES. Side mission design anybody?
- Rest of the side missions is not better at all - you can either drive a truck/boat to rackets to increase their income (this too is completely the same every time) or do an assigment for underbosses to earn their favor and these s*ck too - you only want to do the for Vito to learn about his past and Joe but its not worth it
- Certain cutscenes are premade and locked at 60/30 fps while others support unlocked framerate - WHYYYYY!?
- Clothing - no shopping for clothes, going to barber to change hair/beard cut, you are stuck with limited selection of outfits ( and that is still better than when the game launched as there was no customization to speak of)

72443891,76561198103965337,"This game had so much potential, but it fails in my opinion. In the end I am giving it a thumbs down because its repetitive and has some weird design choices that doesn't suit the Mafia series well.

This review comes from a Mafia fan who didn't want to touch this entry from this series, but I've only gave it a chance because I've got it for basically 5€ in that Mafia DE bundle.
The mechanics of this game feel weird (shooting, driving) at first, but you can get used to it. I have no idea how they have gotten worse from Mafia 2, even tho the game runs on the same engine. The driving feels unrealistic and the gunplay is unpolished.

The story of this game is… good i guess? Before I’ve finished the game I was hating on the story but the grand finale kinda got me. Still the story isn’t as astounding as it was in the first or second Mafia game but the story was decent overall. I have only two complains about it, first there is a huge dead space between the start and the end in the story and second, the end is too long. In my opinion the credits should have appeared as soon as you kill the main villain of this game. Instead after beautiful ending, you still have to drive and do some decisions before the credits appear.

The mission design on the other hand… well, it’s a mess. And a main reason this game got a dislike from me. The introduction to this game is O.K., then there is a huge repetitive cycle of: “Go to these two guys, they will tell you about the two rackets here, then deal X amount of damage to these rackets, then kill the leaders of these rackets, after that kill the main guy behind the two guys you’ve just killed, then (the only interesting part of the game) is killing the leader of the district you’re taking over. It would be fine if you would have to repeat this cycle a few times, but you gotta do this 9 times throughout the game, that means doing X amount of damage to rackets (which is the most painful part) 18 times overall. Most of the time the missions are just mindless shooting and most of the stuff feels like a daily questing in MMORPG’s. But there are some exceptions. As I said, killing the main boss of the district and then the final boss itself are part of unique missions and it almost feels like you’re actually playing a Mafia game.

Next the graphics of this game: I don’t know what they did, but the game looks awful. It’s blurry and really dark. I’ve played on the maximum settings and it didn’t help. 

Also, this game is so utterly breaking the Mafia formula… For example, cops in any other Mafia game are pain in the ass and they want to punish you for every crime you do (speeding, stealing a car). But in this game, they are an absolute joke, they never go for you, they can’t also issue you a ticket, they can only shoot at you, feels a lot like GTA cops. Next you have to assign districts etc. to your “partners”, also feels again like a GTA game. Also you never go on a mission with your partners. They also gave Lincoln wallhack and slow motions abilities for some god knows what reason, the game would be fine without them.

Next, the city is so dead. Don’t get me wrong, every Mafia game had that, but in I and II you had no incentive to go into the town, it was just used to travel from point A to point B. In mafia II you had to visit a garage or a clothes shop to get rid of the wanted level at least, but both Mafia I and II weren’t open world games. And I actually like that. But this game presents itself like an open world game. But there are no shops or anything you would ever need. You have your phone so you can do a few phone calls to get your car guns, whatever you like.
Bug wise, I’ve only encountered few where I couldn’t pick up an object to complete a mission or NPC got stuck somewhere and I had to reload the checkpoint. But the game was functional (at least for me).

Closing words: This game wasn’t as far as I thought away from being a good game. But it’s still by no means good. If you’re a diehard Mafia fan like me, then go for it, play this game with the lowest expectations you can, and you will be pleasantly surprised. If you never played a Mafia game before, finish I and II first, its much more worth it. I’d love to play this game again to do different decisions with my districts, but I’m not going to do X amount of damage 18 times ever again.",1594396902,1608672823,0,0.5,2150,190,1599851402,"{""recommendationid"": ""72443891"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198103965337"", ""num_games_owned"": 57, ""num_reviews"": 12, ""playtime_forever"": 2150, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 190, ""last_played"": 1599851402}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""This game had so much potential, but it fails in my opinion.

and this game dont have new game + mode , if you clear all story , then really game is over , the only thing left to you , is an boring empty city , no more enemy to kill , no more South 3K to kill .

no free side missions allow you to play again and again like Mafia II Jimmy DLC , no free enemy point allow you to attack again and again .

71929221,76561198035293766,"    This review isn't really a definitive yes from me, but hear me out. There are a plethora of good things I can say for this game: 1. it introduces a wide array of interesting characters, 2. the story is excellent and provides a whole lot of cathartic moments for the player, 3. the world is beautiful and seeing a 60's Louisiana is pretty awesome. 4. period accurate events, such as segregation puts things into perspective and really gives a voice to the African Americans state of living. It all sounds great on paper, but here's the catch if you want to experience all this: the entirety of the gameplay loop being based solely on districts and racket busting (going to x and y, story, rinse and repeat). If I didn't really want to do the same bit a second time then I sure as hell wouldn't want to do it for the 20th time with the only difference being who I was killing, and even that wasn't all too different.
    While the gameplay was extremely tedious, I was able to blast through districts pretty fast (pro tip: switch up your gameplay styles to salvage at least some fun); it can be pretty mindless fun at times. And when all things were said and done, I've got to say that I enjoyed it. The DLC's that are included since this is the Definitive Edition allow for a much better experience and I think that it's what saved this game for me. I honestly got so excited to play Sign of the Times because of the whole investigation gimmick, which was basically L.A. Noire: Occult Edition, and I wasn't disappointed (by this DLC, nor the other 2). 
    Another thing I feel the need to address is the porting job. I felt the handling of the port has improved since other reviews have surfaced as the game has been patched of most of its bugs. While I have experienced some softlocks here and there, a simple checkpoint reload did the trick and didn't bother me all that much. The large amount of reviews and discussion I've read regarding the framerate issues and graphical bugs didn't really seem to affect me and I thought the game played at a respectable framerate and that it looked absolutely amazing with its lighting.
    Overall, while I think that the game had so much potential in the gameplay department and that it could have spent a lot more time in the R&D phase, it really shines with its storytelling, characters, and DLC. Play it, but be ready for a whole lot of repetition.",1593757337,1593757337,1,0.54356849193573,1892,1887,1607908672,"{""recommendationid"": ""71929221"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198035293766"", ""num_games_owned"": 648, ""num_reviews"": 26, ""playtime_forever"": 1892, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1887, ""last_played"": 1607908672}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""    This review isn't really a definitive yes from me, but hear me out.

If I didn't really want to do the same bit a second time then I sure as hell wouldn't want to do it for the 20th time with the only difference being who I was killing, and even that wasn't all too different.\n    While the gameplay was extremely tedious, I was able to blast through districts pretty fast (pro tip: switch up your gameplay styles to salvage at least some fun); it can be pretty mindless fun at times. And when all things were said and done, I've got to say that I enjoyed it. The DLC's that are included since this is the Definitive Edition allow for a much better experience and I think that it's what saved this game for me. I honestly got so excited to play Sign of the Times because of the whole investigation gimmick, which was basically L.A. Noire: Occult Edition, and I wasn't disappointed (by this DLC, nor the other 2). \n    Another thing I feel the need to address is the porting job. I felt the handling of the port has improved since other reviews have surfaced as the game has been patched of most of its bugs. While I have experienced some softlocks here and there, a simple checkpoint reload did the trick and didn't bother me all that much. The large amount of reviews and discussion I've read regarding the framerate issues and graphical bugs didn't really seem to affect me and I thought the game played at a respectable framerate and that it looked absolutely amazing with its lighting.\n    Overall, while I think that the game had so much potential in the gameplay department and that it could have spent a lot more time in the R&D phase, it really shines with its storytelling, characters, and DLC. Play it, but be ready for a whole lot of repetition."", ""timestamp_created"": 1593757337, ""timestamp_updated"": 1593757337, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 2, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.54356849193572998"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": false, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

Mafia 3 is one of the best games I have ever played, and it is certainly the most enjoyable driving game I have ever played. A moment of complete elation occurred in game recently when I smashed through a billboard of a  villainous character that showed up in the story moments earlier. It was a completely organic moment that was the result of me just exploring and enjoying the driving physics, and I was literally screaming with excitement at how awesome the moment was. This game does this so much to me that I have to call it one of the best games ever. It is fun. it is exciting. It is pure gameplay without exceptions. 

It's difficult for me to believe how good this game is after all the bad reviews. Mafia: City of Lost Heaven has always been my favourite game. Mafia 2 was slightly disappointing for me, but I'm glad a lot of people like it. I was avoiding playing this game until I realised that a certain percentage of people are going to rate this game negatively purely based on prejudice alone, so I decided to give it a try. Wow, simply wow. It's amazing, I'm blown away. Mafia has always been the quality to GTA's quantity, and this game follows suit by improving upon the open world crime format in almost every way. 

I could not even buy this game as it is unavailable in South Africa, probably due to it's racial themes, themes which are still relevant today, today now in 2020 more than ever. On the radio in the game you hear protesters call for a disarmament of the police. this is not a new issue. The brutality of the police is an issue that has persisted for generations. Mafia has always turned a serious light on crime and violence where GTA satirises it. The first game made me realise as a child how the police are just gangsters working for the larger mafia of the government, and this game really drives that point home.

This is an experience like none other. Buy it.

CONS

All that being said I wish the cops cared about speeding. In Mafia 1 cops would give you a ticket for speed or running a red light. Mafia 2 removed the feature where cops recognise running red lights, and Mafia 3 removed recognition of speeding. I don't understand why you would want to remove features from the game. Mafia 3 has a radar and every time you drive past a cop a blue line appears on the screen, so the system is perfectly set up for speeding and obeying traffic laws, but cops just ignore you, so you can drive however you want. It breaks immersion. I really hope Mafia 1 remake has these things

EDIT: The game makes up for some of the above issues with the introduction of zones of varying police intensity.

The game is visually impressive, at least now that the glitches are fixed. I don't how the graphics are SUPPOSED to look like, on the initial release years ago.

71679574,76561198200879134,"After 3 playthroughs, I decided it's time to give this game a review. a different one from the majority of ""Not Recommended"" you see here. Mafia III Is deeply flawed and after the Definitive Edition upgrade, it yet remains the same but it had something special that kept me playing it for such a long time, I simply couldn't leave a thumb down on it.

[h1]Story[/h1]
🔹Mafia III tells the tale of Lincoln Clay, a colored man who got screwed by the greed of the Italian mob ruling the fictional New Bordeaux based on New Orleans. He loses his family and father figure and now he's out for revenge. However, this is not your average vengeance story that ends just with killing the bad guy. Lincoln wants to take everything Sal Marcano the mob boss has worked for, makes him suffer just the way he did by busting up his rackets, taking over the city district by district and killing closest to Sal including his wife, son, and brothers. Throughout the game, after each main mission completed comes up a cutscene where the people who knew Lincoln the most are participating in a documentary show on his life and actions, picturing real-life photos and videos. This is where is the story shines the most as you realize piece by piece on Lincoln's background and the damage he inflicted on the mob.
🔹Hangar 13 made the right call giving you a handful of choices for how to end Lincoln's fate which added to the replay value.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b][u]Showing them who's in charge[/u][/b]
🔹Probably the only aspect of Mafia III that covered for the whole game. Taking over the city after progressing enough through the story to unlock all 3 underbosses can be tedious. The same style of ""Damage this business enough to draw out the capo"" or ""Make the informant talk so he gives up where to damage the business enough to draw out the capo"" will bore you to death but at the same time, it has a special and strong pull making you go after every point of interest deliberately (This might have to do with the need for money as in for the base game it's your only big source of income). Then it's time to confront the lieutenants in the main story missions which play out differently and take place under different circumstances that'll kick up the game considerably.

[b][u]Driving[/u][/b]
🔹Couldn't be done any better imho. Great variety of vehicles with a dozen 60s muscle cars which all are wonderful to drive around. Unlike other open-world TPS games where cars are made out of tin can and smallest bump in the road makes your car goes flying, Mafia III vehicles actually weigh for something. Crashing into the environment and other cars won't go so lightly. your car might not spin out of control but certainly takes a huge hit to the speed. On the other hand, driving mechanics are masterfully done close to a point you'd think they're taken out of an arcade racing game. Grip, Acceleration, Handling, and just everything about it is solid. Not to mention there comes a good variety of customizations for cars unlocked by doing races around the city.

[b][u]Gunplay[/u][/b]
🔹I've been using Max Payne 3 as a measuring system for how cool the shootings play in a game and Mafia III is almost nothing less than that (Hell, it even comes with a slow-mo ability just like Max Payne). Although some of the weapons might not have proper sound effects but shooting them regardless, feels like packing a real punch, enemies react to being shot, and the recoil kicks back just enough to delivers a satisfying experience. The Covering system is also implemented perfectly. Sticky covers where you can easily get out by going in the opposite direction with the addition of blind shooting to create amazing and realistic gunfights.

[b][u]The dumbed-down AI[/u][/b]
🔹You can choose to go in quiet or guns blazing shooting the place up, but AI remains the same dumb AI no matter what. Enemies have a few scripted behaviors such as ""Searching, Aggressive, Combat"". Nonetheless, you wouldn't notice a big difference between them. They would easily give up on searching for you, or situation can quickly escalate from aggressive to combat when you're warned for trespassing even if you're walking away, sometimes they storm your cover one by one so you'll have an easier time picking them off. Can't even stress enough on how AI provides a lackluster challenge during car pursuits by tending to only shoot out the tires and if they manage to stop your car, you can sit right there pissing yourself laughing and counting how many shots these cops gonna miss while standing right in front of your windshield.

[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]
🔹an OST of curated songs from Country, Blues, Soul to Classic Rock helping establish the southern mood of the 60s in the game. CCR's ""Proud Mary"", ""Fortunate Son"", ""Born on the Bayou"", Aretha Franklin's ""Respect"", ""Somebody to Love"" by Jefferson Airplane and many more impressive hits that simply won't fit the size of my review can be heard not only in your car but in every bar and diner around the city.
🔹Considering the racist theme game was set on, the voice acting crew did a decent job with the southern accent and the black language. Alex Hernandez, Gordon Greene, Jay Acovone, and many others made their respective characters unforgettable for me.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
🔹This is the spark that burned Mafia III down. I could simply say technical issues and put a plus infinite sign in front of it but I'll go into some of them anyway. Not gonna complain much on the optimization because miraculously I managed to finish the game twice on a GT730 1GB and 3rd time on a GTX1050 that got me around 30fps on max settings with only a couple of crashes during the entire playthrough and time to time 2-3sec freezes which weren't something I couldn't put up with.
[list]
    [*]Reflection effects don't work properly most of the time with cars' surface and upon going indoors, Lincoln and objects suddenly render with a desaturated (Like silvery metal) texture for several seconds until the actual thing kicks in
    [*]Overall Image is a BLURRY SHET-SHOW to an eyesight weakening level (Use of ReShade along with Image sharpening feature is highly recommended)
    [*]Intrusive HUD with no option to limit or turn off that ruins the immersion
    [*]View Distance not befitting an 8th gen AAA title especially for the PC port
    [*]Clothing during cutscenes stretch all over when characters start moving
    [*]Lincoln can have a bottomless shadow during daylight.
    [*]Poor and somewhat unclear Graphics settings
    [*]Skybox seems low quality
[/list]
[b]And the list goes on but with every low comes a high[/b]
[list]
    [*]Attention to details around the world whether outdoors or indoors are extraordinary and makes up for any other failures
    [*]At least cutscenes are sharp and crispy (Pre-rendered and In-game), letting you enjoy the narrative
    [*]Motion Captures and Facial expressions are to a degree jaw-dropping
    [*]The city looks alive and vivid during both day and night
    [*]Lincoln's movement animations are super smooth
[/list]

[h1]DLC Contents[/h1]
🔹All 3 DLCs come with a short but rather interesting storyline (Adding a new island and Sinclair Parish which both are amazingly more beautiful than New Bordeaux) and extend the gameplay further by adding side quests and introducing interesting businesses to work on such as renovating Sammy's bar that might set you back for thousands of dollars but wouldn't compare to the satisfaction you get from building and running your bar. Now to make up for the loss on the bar, you can get your own freaking GROW HOUSE running. Acquiring new strains, mixing them with new seeds, giving sick names to your new custom plants, watch them grow, and sell them on the market for a fat cash-flow.

71558596,76561197978521047,"First of all, this game won't be for everyone.  It's not perfect.  As a game it sometimes struggles with repetitive gameplay loops, and it has some technical issues.

But I love it dearly.  Let me tell you why.

First of all, the story.  This is the best mix of motion capture, voice acting, and writing I have ever seen in a game.  There is a tremendous amount of scripted story in this game, and it is really, really well done.  The team behind this team have done a great job capturing all the elements that make compelling drama and making them work within the limits of in-game cutscenes.

Second, the setting.  1960's New Orleans (er, New Bordeaux) is very well realised.   It's both large, and feels like a cohesive place.  The music works really well, and it avoids the problems that recent open world games have had where every location feels like a copy-paste of the last.  The setting also works nicely with the plot, allowing (very prescient) themes of racism to edge their way in - which helps make Lincoln a much more sympathetic character.  (After all, if the whole system is against you then what's so wrong about knocking it down?)

That said, the game has it's problems.  For me, they aren't gamebreakers - but for some they will be.

First, the game's tech.  Crank everything up to full detail and it will look like a smeared mess.  Pop in is  aggressive and texture pop in occasionally goes haywire on random objects.  Every now and then the game will bug, and I found myself having to load to the last checkpoint.  Textures are also a distracting mix of the very good and godawful.

(My advice: Turn Anti aliasing down and turn off motion blur.  Strong Temporal AA and the aggressive Blur functions make everything blurry and fuzzy for me).

Second, the gameplay.  The difficulty curve is weirdly difficult during the first few 'tutorial' missions, which can be off putting once you start playing.  When you realise you need to treat it more like a stealth game than a third person shooter it will click into place.  It's also occasionally repetitive - and throws a number of onerous fetch quests at you.  The setting is nice, but being forced to endlessly drive slow vehicles across it sucks the joy right out of the setting.

So there you have it.  If you are willing to put up with gameplay I would characterise as 'passable' overall, in exchange for an amazing setting and well told story, then I would recommend the game to you.",1593337582,1593337582,1,0.5,4100,1567,1745721531,"{""recommendationid"": ""71558596"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197978521047"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 2, ""playtime_forever"": 4100, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1567, ""last_played"": 1745721531}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""First of all, this game won't be for everyone.

Lincoln Clay – a Vietnam War veteran who returns home in 1968 to his old neighbourhood in New Bordeaux (~ New Orleans) – is the protagonist of Mafia III, the third game in the Mafia Series. Mother Dominican, and father white, possibly Italian, as Father James says when talking about Lincoln: [i] “Not that it mattered - back then if you looked black, you were black. Same as today, I suppose.” [/i] 

[b] To make it short: [/b] it's a good third-person open world action-adventure game with a great story – characters and cinematic cutscenes – good gunplay and a fantastic soundtrack. It's got a few evident defects (first of all a few persistent bugs and repetitive racket-related missions), but classifying this game as rubbish, as I've seen happening many times, is as ignorant as superficial. Certainly, it's a very underrated game.

I’ve played the Definitive Edition, so I've never had to deal with its problematic debut in 2016. And judging it now, [b] it's everything except unplayable. [/b] Before blaming the game, I'd check if you can handle it. A ROG notebook with a GTX 1060 can run GTA V, RDR 2 and Mafia III in high settings in 1080p without problems. And be careful the Nvidia control panel didn't choose to run it with the integrated graphic card. If so, simply switch to the dedicated GPU.

Graphically [b] it's a nice-looking game. [/b] Hangar 13's proprietary engine, here at its debut, would have needed a few improvements and a little more optimization, but combined with a fine reconstruction of New Bordeaux can give quite realistic imagery and great visuals. There're still some technical issues such as a limited depth of field, texture pop-in, especially while driving, and issues with some reflections (who said mirrors?). Talking about bugs and glitches, despite I've played the story twice, I've never encountered anything so annoying, except some situation where NPCs get stuck (fixed reloading the last checkpoint) and unfortunately several glitched achievements.

[b] Storytelling and characters are simply great. [/b] It’s a tale of revenge, in a period (and in a country) full of violence, racism and mass protest movements. Lincoln is a cool character, and John Donovan is simply amazing. I'd bet many players have never accepted the fact of playing with such a character, because prejudice and bigotry are all over the place. Anyway. Nice vehicle models and pretty good driving (the simulated one). [b] Loved the gunplay, really satisfying. [/b] The weapons feel heavy, you can feel the impacts of the gunshots. Good cover system and animations in general. Game's big fault, as I said, is the constant reiteration of the same gameplay mechanic for the racket-related missions. But the missions against the Marcano Crime Family are really cool, as well as the locations, from the abandoned amusement park to The Royal Hotel and the Casino.

Good cover system and animations in general. Game's big fault, as I said, is the constant reiteration of the same gameplay mechanic for the racket-related missions.

+ Alot of customization in regards to your clothing and rides you can trick out
+ All previous DLC that were paid are now free, they have their own stories to which adds value to the game especially those who did not buy the game initially with the season pass

- Graphics could be improved considering 2k rebadged the game as remaster and supposedly patched the game, there are mods to make the images sharper or using re-shade tools
- Can be abit repetitive especially when taking over turf
- Lack of other activities if you compare it to GTAV it is very limited activities available are just races, pickup & drop off activities

71314195,76561198034663234,"I was excited to have a modern Mafia game and I wouldn't go so far to say this is a bad game... but I'd question whether or not you should buy this.
Audio issues, game locks and vehicle spawn bugs are annoying but are the least of the problems. The story is alright, but the gameplay through it relies on a repetitive un-rewarding gameplay cycle that isn't fun. 
I didn't like that Mafia 2 went to the effort to develop a large open world, but never gave a reason to explore or do anything in it. Mafia 3 fixes this with the open world, but most of the tasks are very mundane and you'll spend most your time driving from one end of the city to another, often forced to do so in a slow truck, and you need to pray no one shoots out a tire and triples the time it takes to make the trip.
This goes into direct contrast with the Associate system which is buttery smooth and delivers a bank, free high end cars of your choice and an arms dealer, to your location, for free, wherever you are in less than 10 seconds. It's tremendous how enjoyable this is.... but then the game expects you to drive 10 minutes across the city to start a mission where you drive all the way back again to shoot one guy. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
Atleast this game looks great, and with the classic music selection on point, I never felt out of place here. I just felt like my time was wasted on the mundane. If this was a more condense. linear game I might have less problems with the tedious, but then would have more complaints about the lack of open world utilisation.
If only Hanger 13 could find some other similar genre games and figure out how they manage player progression, mission rewards, open-world to improve upon.

Mafia 1 is one of my all time favs and playing this before it's remaster has me filled with hope... but I'm not having to calm, because this took the excitement away for me.

71283257,76561198018153306,"Definitive Edition TL;DR: 82/100

Neutral:
- Revenge story heard 100 times before
- Fast driver sees people's tendency to jump under wheels of his car
- Graphical glitches in cut-scenes (Definitive Edition launch) solved by latest patch, now only very rare graphical glitches in the game world

Negative:
- Some bugs preventing further progress (solved by reloading checkpoint if possible or restarting game if frozen in loading)
- Repetitive missions
- Too many 'electronic parts' collectibles (over 350), good thing there's likely no achievement for getting all so only get as much as you need for unlocking 'towers'
- Post-DLC content feels like padding (again repetition)

Positive:
- Great characters
- Overall good story
- Interesting documentary approach to story-telling
- DLC stories are fun
- Action while repetitive tactics, engaging until the finale (and heard it will be again in original Mafia remake)
- Graphics (nothing added in Definitive Edition, still solid and nice-looking)

For DLC, I'd recommend to finish Faster, Baby! rather sooner than later because post-DLC content is driven by time passing.

Really enjoyed this game after I replayed kind of messed up Mafia 2 Remastered Edition (played original when it released) and finally got to Mafia 3 which I did postponed before. While the grind was strong (especially when I wanted to collect everything including the electronic parts) and some missions were repetitive, the story pieces when protagonist Lincoln finally got turn for action and main events, more than balanced it.

71251914,76561198074661529,"The number one complaint that most people have about this game is that the gameplay is repetitive. Which is true but it took me a while to really get sick of it, in fact I was almost finished the game but finally gave up because of the repetitive missions. The reason I kept playing for so long is because this game is also awesome in many ways. While the DLC also adds some much needed variation to the gameplay.

When you play through the game though you can see that the repetition is more of an unfortunate consequence of a better game play idea which makes up the bigger picture of what you are actually doing. Basically the idea is that you are taking over districts in the city and building your empire while assigning power to your under bosses. Which is fun in terms of the bigger picture but very repetitive and drawn out on a mission to mission basis. It’s actually just lazy game design because with a few tweaks and a bit more thought put into it they could have easily made an excellent game. There are some other disappointing design elements here too which break immersion such as not being able to close doors behind you. Considering the awesome level of detail in other areas these little oversights are disappointing.

I mean in general with this game there are great ideas and fun game play mixed with lazy design and blatant filler. There are also some out right stupid things that happen towards the end of the game that show a straight up lack of motivation by the developers. It’s a real shame because there are a lot of good things to say about this game too. If you buy it on a sale and reduce your expectations before playing you will most likely have a good time over all. 
 
Just like Mafia 2 this game has a genuinely awesome soundtrack which given that it’s based in the 1960’s is really enjoyable. As the main character is also black during a very racist time and place this game is interesting in the way that it deals with racism. It might actually be worth playing just to experience that aspect of it. It reminded me of Tarantino’s Django Unchained in the way it uses Racism as part of the main character's motivation. The developers also didn’t hold back when dealing with this topic and it’s a pretty unique game in that sense. 

There's some good level design here too with multiple entry points when approaching missions. The game looks gorgeous for the most part and there is some real attention to detail put into some of the environments. The cars are awesome and really fun to drive while the gun play is satisfying and well designed. There are also NPC services available such as a mobile gun shop which is nice. However the AI is screwed up so when they arrive they will usually crash straight into you or your vehicle. Uncle Joey Diaz from The Joe Rogan Experience podcast is in this game too with a short cameo appearance which is fun.

As a AAA game at full price Mafia 3 definitely deserves all the criticism that it has gotten since it’s release. It’s a real shame though because even though it’s seriously flawed there was also a lot of good work put into making this game. It’s definitely worth playing and I had fun with it, in fact it’s the perfect game for a Steam sale on PC. Hopefully Mafia 4 will follow through on the good things that this game does and deliver a more polished experience.

+ The graphics are decent
+ Very authentic New Orleans Environment
+ Driving can actually be quite fun, steering and maneuvering is quite satisfying.

Cons:
- All missions (but the prologue) are the same. Rush or sneak in, kill everyone, steal something/interrogate someone/destroy something.

Well simple 30 minutes in and all I get from the launcher is ""Your system doesn´t meet minimum requirements"", which is right I pass minimum eaily and even recommended.

While this message does appear in other games which I play with no issues, this one does not want me to play it.

In the 30 minutes I did nothing but ""play"" with the setting to at best get a camera control that rolls all around the character at outrageous speeds and a nice 23 to 68 frames per second that changes every single sentence the characters talked.

The good:
The story is by far the shining star in the game, playing out as if it's a documentary. The cut scenes when they decide to actually load in for you are shockingly intriguing. The Mocap done for the game was surprisingly good, the acting on par. If you are one of those people who love games in which you can just abuse the ai- do it. 

The Bad:
I cannot tell you the amount of times cut scenes just didn't load in, or when starting a new mission with an informant, they just froze- both having me to restart the game. Mirrors are fucking unsettling. Driving in this game is such a nightmare. Bushes are made of concrete, I've lost objectives because my car hit an invisible wall, or even an umbrella causing me to spiral out of control. Missions seem to repetitive, much too repetitive for a game that took me almost 70 hours.

My take:
With this game and it's faults one of the things I found myself doing while on missions is just seeing how much chaos I can really cause the game. Pedestrians will just jump out in front of you as if they have a death wish- thus getting hit with a 60's muscle car going 130 mph. By the time someone has called the police you're halfway across the map. The notoriety mechanic in this game is laughable at best. I used my perks a total of 4 times during my play through (to lose notoriety). You can play this game almost completely by stealth (which is a broken and complete mess of a mechanic) because the AI logic is just a mess..

All in all for a game that came out in 2016, I had higher expectations, however knowing the curve balls the developers went through some of this mess is understandable. My overall suggestion is find a play through of the cut scenes and you'll be much better off. I personally found myself wanting to play GTA rather than chugging through this game.

I am not a person who would gladly place a negative review on a game, I simply tend to ignore it after I finish it. But sometimes you need to draw a line. So here is mine. Keep in mind that this is my personal experience after I completed everything. If you disagree with this and want to share your opinion, feel free to do so, but be polite!

When you read some reviews on Steam which are listing all the negative aspects of this game you may think they are wrong, but I learned they are not. I gave this game more than a simple chance. 

This review you're about to read is coming from a guy who enjoys every Far Cry's level of repetition, from a guy who enjoyed and completed Assassin's Creed Odyssey and all its possible side-missions. And who doesn't have the problem to invest his time in doing something like that. But I have a line too. In one word, playing this game I realized that I am a pure masochist. And even though I completed this game, I think I failed the patience test because I had to write this negative review.

I didn't have the opportunity to play this game before the Definitive update got released, but all the problems that I've seen and read this game had before, they can occur on this edition as well.

This game is almost like an RNG (random number generator) where it may work for one user and for another it doesn't work properly no matter what. Maybe I'm the unlucky one here. But some aspects can't be attributed to luck. This is my personal experience and I didn't expect it's going to be like this.

[h1]The cons:[/h1]
[b]- Graphics:[/b]
Blurred mess with some kind of smudgy orange tint all over the place. I don't understand the decision in making something like this and thinking it may look good and it may give retro style vibe to the game. It just doesn't. I was using Reshade and that was the only possible way to override the mentioned color settings. Maybe it would be better if I didn't play on 27'' monitor with FHD resolution. But I tried with DSR to 1440p and it also looks the same. Blurred mess without Reshade.

[b]- Bugged missions:[/b]
You come to the point where you need to finish a certain mission, press the key to start the sequence and that should be it. Unfortunately, it is. Nothing is happening so you have to restart your game and hope it'll work next time. It usually does work. But that's still broken.

[b]- Glitched achievements[/b]
Now we're talking. If you are an achievement hunter, you, by default, need to play this game 2 times. If everything works fine, that is. Didn't work for me.
In the middle of my first playthrough I found a working solution on how to make your achievements work if the achievements with ""counters"" are glitched. Those are where you need to kill more enemies in a certain way. Unfortunately, that solution didn't work for every achievement. If you encounter the glitch on your current and probably your main save for the story missions, forget that save. You'll have to start all over again in order to unlock that achievement. Thankfully, you can find some save files on the web and use that if you didn't create your own backups. But that still takes you only after the first part of the story.

[b]- Awful animations:[/b]
Cutscenes are fine and somewhere interesting, depending on your preferences. But in-game dialogues are terrible. You stand in front of a mission-giver like a robot while he is talking something. Once he is done, short and awkward pause comes in and then you give a response. Completely unmotivated or anything that would give some signs of life.

[b]- Raining simulator:[/b]
This game actually looks good when it's raining cause it adds puddles on the roads and that creates nice reflections. But why ""simulator""? Because it can rain even if there are no clouds. NPCs are reacting to the rain, you can see they try to get a shelter, walking faster and such. But not in this case scenario. And it rains all the time. A solution I have found on the internet was to die on purpose. Actually works. Although, you get tired of it cause almost every night or morning it starts to rain.
You can maybe find that some people say how this game is set in Gulf Coast of United States (fictional town New Bordeaux) and how it rains there all the time or very often so it's more close to realism. I don't know, didn't check on that. But heads up, you can see through walls in this game, yet again, they decided that the rain should be close to realism? Hard to think so.

[b]- Utterly boring:[/b]
Yes! You remember how  I said I like Far Cry's repetitions? This one is another story. You go to one mission-giver, he talks about something, you go to that location, kill everything that moves, go back and repeat the process because now some other enemies are magically there on the same spots. Really! Really nothing else you need to do in this game. If you consider that the map is not that big actually, you'll find yourself in a box and you can't go out from there. I couldn't stand the fact that you need to do the exact same thing over and over again. Some other games that I mentioned at least have some variety in locations if nothing else.

[b]- Predictive storyline:[/b]
Nothing that would amaze me here. Really nothing. Did you play Mafia 2? Do you remember the ending? Oh, that was something. Here? Nothing. You already know what will happen if you want to see the real ending. And if you are not a sadist in some way you won't miss it. The only thing that was interesting to me is on how you'll divide districts in the city and that some choices have different impact.
On the other hand DLCs were kinda different, so I can say that I enjoyed playing them.

[b]- Stupid AI:[/b]
Every game needs easier mechanics so that the player can beat the game with the stealth. I understand that. But in this game that's on another level. You just need to stand in one place and use the whistle button. Literally. They will come to you so you can take them one by one with stealth approach. Tedious process so if you don't want to be annoyed that much, just don't play that way. On harder level you have some challenge, but that's it.

[h1]The pros:[/h1]
[b]- Performances were fine.[/b]
Stable 60 FPS at 1080p with all settings on max. I have i5 8500, 1660 Ti, 16 GB with Windows 10.

[b]- Uninstalls well.[/b]
Simple enough.


If you had just the main game without DLCs, good for you, you received DLCs for free in the latest Definitive update. If not, don't buy this game for this price. It's a shame and demeaning towards developers to say something like this, but don't pay more than 5 -7 € for this game. For most problems in this game there is a fix on the internet. But that still doesn't mean that you need to be a google-expert in order to play this game and finally finish it.

Really! Really nothing else you need to do in this game. If you consider that the map is not that big actually, you'll find yourself in a box and you can't go out from there. I couldn't stand the fact that you need to do the exact same thing over and over again. Some other games that I mentioned at least have some variety in locations if nothing else.\n\n[b]- Predictive storyline:[/b]\nNothing that would amaze me here. Really nothing. Did you play Mafia 2? Do you remember the ending? Oh, that was something. Here? Nothing. You already know what will happen if you want to see the real ending. And if you are not a sadist in some way you won't miss it. The only thing that was interesting to me is on how you'll divide districts in the city and that some choices have different impact.\nOn the other hand DLCs were kinda different, so I can say that I enjoyed playing them.\n\n[b]- Stupid AI:[/b]\nEvery game needs easier mechanics so that the player can beat the game with the stealth. I understand that. But in this game that's on another level. You just need to stand in one place and use the whistle button. Literally. They will come to you so you can take them one by one with stealth approach. Tedious process so if you don't want to be annoyed that much, just don't play that way. On harder level you have some challenge, but that's it.\n\n[h1]The pros:[/h1]\n[b]- Performances were fine.[/b]\nStable 60 FPS at 1080p with all settings on max. I have i5 8500, 1660 Ti, 16 GB with Windows 10.\n\n[b]- Uninstalls well.[/b]\nSimple enough.\n\n\nIf you had just the main game without DLCs, good for you, you received DLCs for free in the latest Definitive update. If not, don't buy this game for this price. It's a shame and demeaning towards developers to say something like this, but don't pay more than 5 -7 € for this game. For most problems in this game there is a fix on the internet. But that still doesn't mean that you need to be a google-expert in order to play this game and finally finish it.\n\n[i][b]Overall rating 2/10[/b][/i]\n\nI told you, I am a pure masochist."", ""timestamp_created"": 1592230524, ""timestamp_updated"": 1592261208, ""voted_up"": false, ""votes_up"": 215, ""votes_funny"": 22, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.83955150842666626"", ""comment_count"": 29, ""steam_purchase"": false, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

Let me get the one major con out of the way....

It's grindy -- if you read the whole review you'll see why I tolerate the grindiness of the game but it is not for those who hate grindiness. Most of the missions are rinse and repeat. You go after an underboss, you diminish two of the rackets his district controls, and then you kill the underboss. Breaking up the rackets is almost always through infiltrating a building and killing everyone there. It's OK, but mindless and grindy.

The reason I tolerated the grind was because I love the story, and the look and feel of the city. If you love open worlds, this game is worth it. New Bordeaux and the surrounding swamp land is very well designed and detailed. You do feel as if you are in the U.S. south in the 60's. The DLC that comes bundled with the Definitive Edition is worth it too. 

The story is great and the voiceover actors are above average. It is well written but there is a lot of harsh language. Remember, this is largely a story about race and so you should expect a lot of language related to race. 

Finally, the game does allow you to make key decisions that may affect what happens. You work with several people who want a larger piece of the pie. You need to make decisions on what territories they get. Piss one off too many times and you may find yourself with new enemies. 

All-in-all, I would recommend this to those who like open world games, and following a well written storyline adventure.

70634727,76561198105445916,"Mafia III certainly doesn't deserve a lot of the hate it gets; it is essentially a game that ALMOST gets everything right, much like Mafia II did before.

An excellent story that places a twist on your generic revenge narrative, and an eclectic cast of interesting characters is what elevates Mafia III above most third-person shooters I've played before. The story is told in a documentary-like style, having characters from Lincoln Clay's past relay information and anecdotes that you play in a series of flashbacks. This is one way in which the story remains fresh compared to employing other simple plot devices. The setting and the race politics just make the story feel so much more legitimate and alive.

As for the gameplay, Mafia III has the best driving I've seen in any open world video game, fun shooting mechanics, brilliant level design, and an overabundance of content to make your purchase worthwhile. I've gotten 50 hours out of the game including the DLC and the majority of the side missions.

That said, there's too much padded side content to increase Mafia III's longevity, something I've been seeing in games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 2, and Grand Theft Auto V for years now. The side content in the game is utterly repetitive, just like it is in the games I just mentioned. Why not have fewer but better quests/missions? This gaming trend of quantity over quality admittedly gets old QUICK, and it's no different here.

Another major issue is the insane amount of annoyances in this game: bugs, CTDs, and save corruption. This kind of thing only happens in ""unfinished games"" that are rushed into distribution before they're ready so that these issues can be ""fixed"" with patches. Again, the Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, and Battlefield series come to mind. The problem is, these games are never actually fixed because the next game is rushed into development. Mafia III shouldn't have these issues, but it does.

And don't get me started on the incessant cops. They're not quite Grand Theft Auto V ridiculous, but they're still f#<king ridiculous, taking away some of the fun of the game. I mean, in what universe will cops shoot with the intent to kill and chase me relentlessly for a minor car crash into them, yet look the other way when I fire an RPG into a crowded restaurant?

The story is told in a documentary-like style, having characters from Lincoln Clay's past relay information and anecdotes that you play in a series of flashbacks. This is one way in which the story remains fresh compared to employing other simple plot devices. The setting and the race politics just make the story feel so much more legitimate and alive.\n\nAs for the gameplay, Mafia III has the best driving I've seen in any open world video game, fun shooting mechanics, brilliant level design, and an overabundance of content to make your purchase worthwhile. I've gotten 50 hours out of the game including the DLC and the majority of the side missions.\n\nThat said, there's too much padded side content to increase Mafia III's longevity, something I've been seeing in games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 2, and Grand Theft Auto V for years now. The side content in the game is utterly repetitive, just like it is in the games I just mentioned. Why not have fewer but better quests/missions? This gaming trend of quantity over quality admittedly gets old QUICK, and it's no different here.\n\nAnother major issue is the insane amount of annoyances in this game: bugs, CTDs, and save corruption. This kind of thing only happens in \""unfinished games\"" that are rushed into distribution before they're ready so that these issues can be \""fixed\"" with patches. Again, the Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, and Battlefield series come to mind. The problem is, these games are never actually fixed because the next game is rushed into development. Mafia III shouldn't have these issues, but it does.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the incessant cops. They're not quite Grand Theft Auto V ridiculous, but they're still f#<king ridiculous, taking away some of the fun of the game. I mean, in what universe will cops shoot with the intent to kill and chase me relentlessly for a minor car crash into them, yet look the other way when I fire an RPG into a crowded restaurant? This s#it kills immersion.\n\nUltimately, Mafia III is a great game just like its predecessor that captures the feel of a modern organized crime ring.

70557421,76561198081093764,"[b]  If you're someone that really likes historical and action games I would definitely recommend Mafia 3 for you. [/b] The action and gameplay are ok and it’s a very immersive game, Mafia 3 really makes you feel like you’re in the 60s or something. [i] But keep in mind that the game has some massive problems that maybe would make you very upset: [/i] 
1 - It has a lot of bugs and glitches that since nowadays weren’t corrected, some of then are very disappointing, like when you walk through the role map to play a mission and it’s simply not able to start it, you have to end another one before (SO WTF IT WAS AVAILABLE ON THE MAP?!?!?!).
2 - Some of the missions are very repetitive, making the experience frustrating. Find some cars, invade this place, kill some random dude, pursue some random dude or a mix of those things are pretty much what all the missions in Mafia 3 are.
3 - Side missions don’t have cutscenes, and I should say that it’s pretty annoying to see the characters standing there, like a ps2 scene. Btw that’s something that’s pretty notable in Mafia 3, although the game was released on 2016, for ps4, when it comes up to cutscenes, I often feel like I’m playing a ps3 game, it sucks.

In general, what I’m trying to say is that if you like the action and the historical background (music, guns, cars, architecture and so on) more than you pay attention to the problems I’ve listed, it’s safe to say that you’re going to enjoy the game.

70494122,76561197984157357,"I want to recommend this game, I really do, but there are just so many issues with it.

You need to do a lot of messing with Nvidia control panel to get it to run consistently, and then the game just fucking stops working sometimes. Idk how it runs on AMD cards, but hopefully its not as bad. 

The game is also just paced like hell. Part of it is the restricting nature of the Mafia franchise. The other part is just unlocking shit. Almost every single thing is locked behind 10ish hours of gameplay, and you can only start to unlock things at that point in time. Unlocking improvements is a fucking chore. You need to do so much work to just get your pistols to be more accurate. Your capos need to be rolling in dough before they give you the most basic of help. Cars are also a giant pain to get. I love the customization options.

At 30 hours in, its a giant pain in the ass.

There are also just some quality of life things that are a giant pain in the ass to deal with. There are no cabs in this game. No fast travel. Going to pick up your kickback money shouldn't feel like a chore. Half of the tasks you'll end up doing for your rackets and your leftianants  are slogs because its just you running back and forth across the whole damn map with very little combat to break it up.

Ratings are a fickle thing, and Steam ratings are easily skewed towards one side or the other. This game has problems on various levels, however I don't think that on a scale as simple as ""positive"" or ""negative"" I could ever rate it negatively.

First off: Yeah, the bugs. There's lots of them. Gamebreaking even. And a bunch of them seem to have been imported into the Definitive Edition, which is annoying but ironically also helpful  because you can draw from old solutions. Outright crashes, game not responding to inputs, mission NPCs not responding or missions not appearing on the map, game freezes, sound partially disappearing when tabbing out... and that's just what I can recall off the top of my head. Thankfully restarting fixes all of these. However, we can all agree they shouldn't be in what is supposedly the ""definitive"" release.

With that out of the way: The story. If Mafia I & II were Martin Scorsese, Mafia III is Quentin Tarantino. Out with ye olde wiseguys, in with Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam war veteran and member of the Black Mob. After being betrayed and the murder of his closest associates, he's out for revenge by taking over the city piece by piece and weakening his ultimate foe in the process.

What starts as a cool concept (albeit not novel) becomes tedious and grindy rather quickly. There's 9 sectors of the city you must gradually take over to progress in the story. And it's more or less always the same. I mean, it's kinda satisfying to see your criminal enterprise grow but then again the gameplay isn't intricate enough to feel like a simulation.

One of the game's strongest points is probably the portrayal of the times: Racial segregation in the 60s & 70s USA. The Vietnam war. The grim reality of racism and discrimination against POCs everyday, any place. There's a particular mission in Frisco Fields that gave me the creeps and I made damn sure to kill everybody in a certain room (no spoilers).

Playing this game these days feels, coincidentally, very relevant again. The death of George Floyd in an act of police brutality, the ensuing riots and protests. We've made strides in overcoming racism but it's sadly not a thing of the past, yet.

70278086,76561198013073496,"First and foremost, this game is a massive letdown compared to Mafia II, a lot of features that made the game so unique and brilliant have been removed or edited for the worst and I'll explain how below.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

The shooting mechanics of the game have changed very little compared to Mafia II, it still follows a fairly generic third-person shooter style of combat, while not bad by any stretch, I wouldn't say that it's breaking any records. One aspect of the game I personally prefer over Mafia II is that you seem to have less ammo in comparison to the previous games in the Mafia series which means you have to be a bit more conservative with your ammo before you get the upgrades. On top of that you now have the ability to blind fire with extreme inaccuracy. If you're looking into Mafia III primarily as a shooter game, I don't know if this would win you over by its self. Melee combat has been severely cut down with a lack of true counters and combos, you have one melee button and one dodge button.

[h1]Driving[/h1]

The driving mechanics of Mafia III took a huge step down from Mafia II, the cars no longer feel heavy and realistic to drive, they've swapped over to a much more user friendly/arcade style of driving, even if you choose to swap over to simulation style driving. Cars are still impacted by the various types of weather which makes for an exciting experience as you have to ease on the throttle and brake early when it's raining, or you can drive a car like it's stolen (which it probably is!) during summer. You are no longer able to store cars in your garage or customise every vehicle like you were able to do in Mafia II, instead you can make cosmetic modifications to your vehicle at Big Rick's Custom Auto, the cosmetic modifications provide more customisable parts than in previous mafia games, but with less options per part such as fewer paint colours. Overall, the driving in Mafia III isn't terrible, but definitely a disappointment considering how good Mafia II was.

[h1]Story/Gameplay[/h1]

The story of Mafia III is significantly less linear than Mafia II, it allows you to take over various districts and distribute them to your fellow underbosses, Cassandra, Thomas Burke, and Vito Scaletta. It's not the first of its kind to do this, but I think it's been fairly well implemented in this allowing you to take over regions by doing various tasks within the area with varying levels of risk and reward. Once you have taken over a district you have to make the decision of who to give it to, with different results depending on who you give them too. 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Mafia III is far from the best game I've ever played, it definitely has its flaws and lacks the same depth as its predecessor, but I can't say I didn't enjoy going around the city, taking down the criminal empire and taking control of the city. The story is also a great continuation from the second game in the trilogy.

It also keeps giving me this error message saying that my computer specs aren't up to parr which is total BS because I'm on an Alienware laptop with i7 2.8ghzs, Nvidia 1060 chip, and 24 gig of Ram.

70170697,76561198025972221,"TL;DR FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO READ MY BOOK-LENGTH REVIEW
This game is good, and treated very unfairly. If you want a good story with great shooting mechanics and don't mind repetitive mission structure, pick it up.

I got this game on its original release. and I hated, hated HATED it. The 30 fps lock, weird lighting, numerous bugs and strange textures. I played it for about 7 hours and refunded it, all while cursing Hangar 13 for ""ruining the Mafia franchise.""

Fast forward almost 4 years and I can now see how wrong I was. In that time there has been a few DLC released, an FPS unlock and numerous other patches. Yes, the story is VERY uneven, with lots and LOTS of cookiecutter missions that play out mostly the same, and YES there are countless bugs (some of them absolutely hilarious), but dig deep and you will find a diamond in the rough my friend.

First off, the soundtrack is phenomenal. A lot of beloved psychedelic songs from the late 60's are in here, with some Soul/Swamp Rock to really even out the 'Nawlins feel. You've got CCR,  The Searchers, Paul Revere and The Raiders, ? And The Mysterians, Count Five, Johnny Cash, Elvis, The Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, The Animals and The Beach Boys to name some of the more famous artists included in the game. I will often find myself just driving around listening to the radio instead of doing missions, the soundtrack is that great. 

Second, the guns. There is a fantastical amount of pistols, rifles, subguns, shotguns and automatic rifles in this game, and all of them do a fine job at mowing down racists by the dozen. The sound effects for weapons in this game are vastly superior to Mafia II and really make firefights more enjoyable (since that's about 90% of the gameplay.) TIP: You want to have some of the most fun you can have with a video game firearm? Pick up the Exterminatore shotgun from the Arms Dealer and thank me later!

Third, the cars. Man there are some nice looking cars in this game, and rightly so, as the late 60's-early 70's was the best time for American car design. You will find the Corvette, Camaro, Shelby GT500, Shelby Cobra, Impala, Thunderbird and more prowling the streets of New Bordeaux. They brought back simulation handling from Mafia II, which makes driving at high speeds way more fun due to the terrible handling. I'm not too big a fan of the way some of the cars sound compared to Mafia II's excellent sound design, but this is a minor nitpick.

THE NEGATIVES: Real quick I'm going to run thru some bad points for this game so I don't come across as totally biased. The Stealth is INCREDIBLY BRAINDEAD. You play as the biggest motherf****r around and if you are crouching, people can't see you until you are within 5 feet of them. The gunplay is also hit or miss. Big weapons like the hunting rifle can be a 1-2 hit kill to the chest depending on whether or not the game feels like it at the moment. THE GLITCHES, OH MY F**KING GOD THERE ARE A LOT. One I can remember off the top of my head was blowing up two Mafioso mid conversation, only for their dialogue to keep going after they died, and after it ended, IT LOOPED AGAIN AND AGAIN until I left the area! Also, don't alt-tab this game a lot or your sound will die on you.

Overall, compared to my first experience with this game in 2016, it has come a long way. Is this a great game? No, but it is a GOOD GAME and nowhere near as bad as people say. If you can put up with grindy gameplay in service of a good story, I would say MAKE SURE YOUR PC MEETS THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE YOU BUY! I personally have had no issues, but I know this has been widely reported so I wanted to add it here before I get flamed.

My rating:

70151603,76561198067159357,"Mafia III is a really cool and one-of-a-kind game. It's not for everyone, but for those who enjoy it, you're in for a treat.

Yes, the missions are repetitive, but if you enjoy the gunplay and gamepaly loop like I do, then it's not a problem.
Combat is viceral and gruesome, you will fall in a matter of a few bullets, and so will your enemies (However, some of the SMGs can feel pretty weak, especially at range).
The death animations before the ragdoll kicks in are incredibly brutal and realistic, which is a big part of why this game is so (sadistically) fun.

The story is realy cool and unique, yes it's a vendetta story, but the side characters introduced to you are very cool, however some are more fleshed out than others, which is sad.
The atmosphere and soundtrack is perhaps the best point of this game, but the graphics are also very wll made, aside from visual glitches which can happen quite often, unfortunately.

All in all, Mafia III is a very fun open-world game with a heavy focus on combat and its main cast of a handful characters, having a somewhat proper treatment.
However, if you don't like open-world games with repetitive, filler content, then you will have to pass on this one, mate.

70101082,76561198018713590,"Mafia 3 is not a great game, at points it isn't even a good one, but it is a game I enjoyed for the 20+ hours it took me to complete. Mafia 3 feels like a good AAA game that made it to the beta stage and then was released. The story is entertaining, well acted and directed, if a little generic, and there are glimpses of details and polish that would more often be found in better games. However, Mafia 3 also suffers from repetitive missions and, most detrimental, poor AI.

Repetitive mission structure is one of the main critiques that gets leveled at this game but I actually don't mind this too much. Each story mission has to be ""unlocked"" by doing enough damage to the criminal racket in the area to draw out the boss. This means you have to drive to areas, kill bad guys, and destroy or steal items. You'll be doing this a lot throughout the game, but it's very easy to make progress. It usually only takes a few minutes of driving around and getting into fun shootouts before you can progress to the main story missions which are fun and interesting, if a little under cooked. 

The definitive edition includes all the DLC which helps with this variety as well. All three DLC side-stories are unlocked pretty early on and you can tackle these in between the main missions. This is how I would recommend playing them, as they are all quite a bit different from the main game and unlock new gear for Lincoln. 

Overall, I'd recommend Mafia 3, but only if you're looking for a decent open world game with a unique setting and perspective, but can overlook some serious shortcomings. At around 10 dollars I'd say Mafia 3 is a good value and a good amount of fun.

==============================
The positives:
==============================

+Great Story.
+Great Dialogue.
+Awesome main character.
+New Bordeaux is well designed. Each district has a different feel to it. There are lots of alleys that add depth to just about each city block. 
+Donovan.
+Some main and DLC missions are pretty good.
+Stellar voice acting.
+Decent firefights (brutal take downs and shooting people in the head never got old for me).
+Decent driving (the cars have a weight to them).

==============================
The negatives:
==============================

-Washed out graphics that otherwise ruin the atmosphere and feel of the town. The graphics just aren't sharp enough even with Nvidia sharpening filter. Lots of dull colors. 

-Atrocious sky box.

-Texture pop-in when driving too fast.

-To unlock most of the main missions you HAVE to complete REPETITIVE side missions (drive to the other side of town, take out a whole bunch of bad guys, repeat - you will do the same type of mission about 30-50 times).

-Repetitive OPTIONAL side missions (these are separate from the repetitive side missions that you need to complete to unlock main missions, but at least these are optional). Ex: steal 3 types of this car; steal 3 types of this boat....seriously?

-The AI is mediocre and is easily outsmarted

-Some of the side missions can be easily exploited: for instance, you infiltrate a racket where the bad guys dwell, you immediately take out the main target and then load the last checkpoint - that way you do not have to break out and escape goons and cops. I did that over and over again to save myself the time and sanity. After you load your checkpont you will spawn at the last safe house. 

============================
Overall, I loved playing as Lincoln Clay. He is definitely one of my favorite game protagonists. His story is the main reason to play the game. However, I had to spend most of the game listening to audio books and such. Driving back and forth and doing the same mundane missions just to see the rest of the story is a crappy game design to say the least.

There is just no reason to make the game any longer than it has to.

Even with it's glitches the graphics especially the lightning is stunning and atmospheric. The overall world design is really pretty.

70031585,76561198020627450,"So, i've been playing it personally for a while now.....
If before i though it's not THAT BAD when i saw full gameplay on the youtube.... now i know that i was completely wrong.

So what do i think.... the biggest issue is that this game are concentrated on racism not because it was everywhere in 1960-70s, and not in the sake of atmosphere, but because it's current standarts for last 6 years for a game - let's make all white people bad and helluva racist (even if current people have nothing with stuff that was going on back then)

Let's get stright to the problems of this game - the story itself and technicall issues.

[b]1) Not following concepts of Mafia (aka Cosa Nostra)[/b]

Let's slide stright into the most breaking moment in the whole concept - Lincoln Clay [u]taking a role of Don in MAFIA HIERARCHY.[/u] Which is on a moment [u]ITALIANS ONLY.[/u] Pardon me but.... that's just beyond stupidity. 
I'm not saying that Lincoln are completely bad character. I'm saying that his ""mafia membership"" makes 0 sense.

[b]*SPOILER ALERT* DUH[/b] (it's not like this game are 4 years old)
[spoiler] The fact that Leo Galante himself admitted that Lincoln can sorta ""join"" Mafia if he'll keep money rollin.... fucked me in the brain. In Mafia 2 Leo and Frank Vinci where those last people in The Commission who were trying to keep the traditions of old times. And now, he, as the part of The Commission accepts non italian in their organization.... Righty'o, why not. [/spoiler]

[b]I don't recall that Lincoln are italian.[/b]

[u]American rednecks[/u] that taking part in [u]Marcano's Italian crime organisation?[/u]
Excuse me? i mean, yeah, they might be associates (lowest step in hierarchy, that are basically not a part of the ""family"" but associated with them) but it's pretty much looks like they are Marcano's soldiers (2nd step in hierarchy, at this point they are a part of the family) or even more - partners which is makes no sense because it's been told by real world gangsters that guy of another nationality, but pure italian, couldn't get a step higher than associate.....(and it was followed in 1st and 2nd games)

Also endless racism..... i mean, yeah, south of the US are famous for their radical views, but jesus christ Hangar 13 don't you think that you pushed things slightly too far?

[b]Conclusion #1[/b]
What did Hangar 13 with whole concept that illusion softworks were working on? Right, they wrote it on the paper, took a huge dump, and wiped themselfs using that paper. 
Why they did that? Obviously because this game doesn't fit current fashion and standarts, italian crime organisation, doesn't seem a good concept. Let's make it inernational. #fucklogic

[b]2) Technical issues.[/b]
I mean, i don't think i can write anything new, but hell....

[b]Soap.[/b]
Just lot's of a fucking soap. And you can't do shit about it. It's just soapy as fuck.

[b]Car physics[/b]
Well, what do you need to know about Car Physics in this game that it's buggy as fuck. You can sit in the car, close the door, and then BOOM it'll jump into the air will do a caouple of barrel rolls and land on it's roof. Cause why fucking not?

[b]Ragdoll and prop physics[/b]
It might be not that much important at the first look, but game ment to be believable 1960s. But every time you shot someone, and that guy just getting froze in time and space and just keep standing there, dead...... 
Or better example. Group of people standing in the cirlce drinking beer. Gunfight happens nearby, that group getting scared and runing away. ""And what's wrong with that?"" you'll ask me. Beer bottles that group drop. Those bottles will just remain hanging in the air. Perfect.

[b]Conclusion #2[/b]
Gameplay are getting fucked up by constantly popping up bugs. Fucked up vision, fucked up physics.... They are just countless.


[b]Thoughts[/b]

What do i think... well, this game would be better as a side story, set in mafia universe with some of improvements to the story and Vito's cameo. But whole concept that non italian guy are going solo-yolo revenge againt Italian-redneck organisation people of which constantly using racial slurs..... In my eyes - it's doesn't work as a ""numbered"" part of the series.

[b]Verdict[/b]
[u]This game are absolute trash at almost everything.[/u]
[list]
[*]Shooting feels like you are using bb guns and shoting plasticine targets.
[*]Stealth are ultra basic.
[*]Driving are glitchy.
[*]Attention to the details that had not hard impact to the gameplay but add charm to it (for which mafia games being loved for, especially the original) are moastly tossed into the shitter.
[*]Animation inconsistency. On one moment, Lincoln doing a move to rich a knife behind his back, do the execution, and then *POOF* knife are just disappearing from the hand.
[*]Too many tips on the HUD, such as markers that pop on the road. i mean, yo, i can read the map you know, i ain't blind.
[*]Story are pretty poorly worked out and most of the concepts (for example - Vito's appearance) were dragged by the balls and nailed to the wall. Even hugeass charismatic Donovan couldn't save the whole situation.

Content is great but again buggy in places. Roll on to the definitive update. 

I was able to run the game on low to mid settings and have a very nice looking and smooth running game. The new update has now made the game entirely unplayable, it looks horrible kinda cartoony in ways and generally I am  just extremely annoyed  that the game I loved to play has become something that i now frown at when i see in my games list. 

In my honest opinion, i think the devs done a really neat thing by giving me the update for free, it was a grand gesture, but it would mean a whole lot more if i could use the game to any benefit. 

I probably wont download another game from this dev in fear that they will later ruin my gaming experience with unexpected game changing updates.

1. Talk to someone
2. Disrupt acitivies in the area. (Steal money, beat up some people, steal money, etc)
3. Talk to the same person again
4. Kill the boss
5. Take over the boss's stuff by calling one of three people

69814205,76561198056870655,"Mafia III is a funny game, funny in that the second to second gameplay is amazing; Probably the most satisfying combat you'll ever experience in a videogame, the minute to minute gameplay is awfully repetitive; you'll speed across the map to clear out another racket or do a fetch quest over and over and over again, but the hour to hour gameplay is oddly satisfying; Progressing the story to that next gorgeous cutscene and taking over the city can feel quite rewarding.

The DLCs help incredibly to break up the repetitiveness of the campaign. Unfortunately all three are available to you as soon as you assemble your allies and it can be quite tempting to burn through them all rather quickly. I suggest you play them in the order they released, but only play one after you take over a district in the main story, so it feels like there is some time that passes between these mini campaigns and they're not crammed one after another.

I would also suggest you vary the gunplay, try out as many guns as you can and don't be afraid to swap during combat from your favourite gun/s, it keeps combat fresh. Now if the gameplay was all you were worried about, that portion of the review is over, the next brief section is on the story.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the story doesn't feel very 'Mafia-esque' , quite the contrary, you don't join a family and rise through it's ranks, you instead destroy one, tearing it to the ground as a kind of 'One Man Army'. Lincoln Clay doesn't even fix back up the black mob to replace it. He just divides the city between three mob bosses, with him as the head-honcho. Whole story starts to feel quite 'circle-jerky' towards the end. The cutscenes for this game, however, are by far the best I have seen in a videogame, almost like they outsourced the mo-cap to a film studio.

Finally, and this is more of a personal gripe with the game, the number of dead bodies Lincoln leaves in his wake is quite ridiculous, making him and his revenge story very hard to sympathize with. I've played through Mafia II recently as the definitive addition just came out and Vito/The Player maybe killed 150 people over 10 in-game years. I swear by the end of Mafia III, Lincoln must have murdered 1000 people in ""a couple months"" (according to an in-game trial).

In spite of all that, the game is still worth a play-through, it has it's highs and lows, but can really come together if you can look past it's faults.

+ Highly destructive enviroment
+ Story and its characters are worthy of attention
+ World feels alive, one of the best enviroments I have seen in a game
+ Engaging sound effects
+ About 48 firearms plus another 7 throwable weapons you can buy for ingame currency
+ Relevant ingame currency that feels important through the whole game (with high difficulty)
+ Adequate DLCs adding more weapons, cars, clothing and new great stories
- Old bugs untouched and new bugs are present
- Buggy cutscenes (stucked animation, missing characters)
- Steam, DS4 or Nintendo Switch Pro controllers sometimes bug ingame interface (no button prompts icons, bugged unlocking minigame)
- Washed out and blurry post process effects
- Extremely dumb and non-adaptive enemy AI (absurd cover choices and pathfinding)
- Repetitive missions, quest giver can actually send to the exact same 4 miles away place TWICE IN A ROW (WHAT THE FUCK)
- Cheating police AI doing 180° turns on spot to not get stuck in enviroment and to substitute terrible pathfinding (visible on minimap or from further distance)
- Minimalizing or using Steam overlay often breaks the whole game and has to be restarted (missing sounds, glitched cutscenes)
- Deleted radio songs without any substitution (expired licenses)
- Game sometimes crashes randomly, no matter what hardware you have
- Any crime you do, police just shoot you (huge downgrade in comparison with older Mafia titles)
- No close combat weapons
- No modding support

Game is technically in a state of early-access title. Technical disaster.

We are finally going to get to see the continuation of the story from the cliffhanger that Mafia II gave us.""

Man, I really wish that was the case.

I'll just go ahead and list the Pros and Cons of this game. I'll start off with the Pros since it's the one with the...least amount of things.

PROS - Great shooting & cover mechanics, awesome setting, soundtrack atmosphere, interesting story characters. 

Now the cons.

CONS - Boring, extremely repetitive missions, muddy graphics, poor game design (guns run out of ammo too quickly, you cannot find ammo except on dead gangsters), LACK OF CONTENT (no houses, garage, gun shops, clothing shops, no restaurants to buy food from) Lack of gameplay features (no robberies, stickups, or activities outside of story & DLC missions). Car physics are underwhelming, especially for a Mafia game. Very buggy and has glitches, even in the re-release. DLC's are short, brief, and mostly unmemorable. ""Definitive"" edition adds nothing except for tweaks and graphics fixes that should've shipped with the game almost 4 years ago. 

VERDICT: For a game that had five to six years of development time, I cannot understand how it could end up like this. It is incomplete, and developers should've been given more time. It's not a horrible game, but pales in comparison to it's predecessors. Buy this game if it's on sale for really cheap, or buy it as part of the Mafia Trilogy.

The gameplay feels stiff and not really solid but Maffia 2 had this problem also, The character you play is not as interesting as Vitto and the optimization of the game well let's just say its not there it runs pretty bad even on a high-end gaming PC and the graphics aren't even that high or nice sure it does like nice sometimes but the maffia 2 Definitive edition does look nicer sometimes and that says a lot... The content you get is also really repetitive. Kill a guy, took over a camp ,steal money took over the HQ call your gang and cutscene that your gang arrives and this is just what you get. You have some fun collectibles sure but the main gameplay is just straight-up boring. 

The driving also feels just clunky and not as solid as in Maffia 2 the NPC's are full-on stupid the stealth mode works like garbage and I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. 

I can't really say anything positive about this game I hope they do better on the next maffia..

Finally, an open world game on the Gulf Goast. Finally, a game in the southern US. Finally, a slice of louisiana in it's old glory.
But nope, it's a giant fuckup and a huge letdown. And this ""definitive"" isn't changing a damn thing.

First, game is not optimized at all. Since launch in 2016 it has constantly run into issues (capped framerates, overbloom, fucked reflections, framerates falling, cutscenes not working...). This ""Definitive"" hasn't done anything towards that, just brings even more bugs.

Second : the constant lazyness. It took everyone to moan everywhere for them to add the BASIC features : Clothes, Car customisation (And it's still limited to the bunch of cars you can get delivered),... And yet, they still scrapped all Mafia II's feature. An open world with nothing inside
[H1]The game just bashes over and over and over that ""Lincoln is a n*gern, so shops owners won't sell him anything or even tolerate him inside, and police will always try to shoot him[/h1]. And there you go about why there isn't any shops, restaurants, or even the police mechanics that made them try to ticket you or arrest you instead of straight up shooting for running a red light.

In that regard, the game is just being plain racist. There is a ton of disclaimers, cultural team accurate depiction etc... But in reality they're just condescending the main character as an amorphic pariah that can't do anything or do anything normal, and when he does it should be praised. That's racism 101. Not the characters and lines, but this differenciated treament of the character.

What is left then for the immersion ? Good old cars all shiny with chrome, V8 and tire bursts ? Don't count on that. Unlike Mafia II which made car driving challenging yet fun, in Mafia III they're just meres soapboxes that will replay the same tire-screeching sound (How did they recorded it ? Pulling a chair on a floor ?) for no reason, absolutely no weight, and however lightly you press the K, lincoln will hammer the sh*t out of it and spin you to hell. The driving is made difficuly only by it's retarded spinning and the imput lag when doing anything (Turning, Braking, Acceleration). Cars are without any personality. Completely forgettable. Even those unnamed 10 cars from The Godfather II had more personality, charm, and more polished sounds than those in Mafia III. I can't remember any of their name nor have any want to drive any, as they all have the same soapbox physics.

Gunfight maybe ? Nope. Pass on. Where Mafia II had a simple but efficient melee combat, there is none of it in Mafia III. And where the second was entirely playable with a Pistol, from the beginning to the endgame, without much difficulties, Mafia III is just yet another modern shooter where pistols are airsoft guns, ennemies are bullet sponges and you have to rely on heavier guns just for the ammo capacity. Also, no efforts where made either on the sounds, it's the same unrealistic one for all guns.

Yet there was no problems recycling some Mafia II assets. While you cannot customise the numbers on your licence plate anymore, you're given the choice between a few pre-mades (Even HNGR13 and 2KCZCH, but why would you want to drive around with the name of those games ruiners splaterred into your face all day long, especially with such a close up camera), the models are straight up recycled from Mafia II, to the point they didn't bothered to fix the EXACT. SAME. Expiration date, still showing 23 Feb 1953,  despite the game takes place in 1968.

And finally, about the story. What story ? There is just no story at all in this game. Past the introduction begining, there will be absolutely no missions or assisgment that are unique and stands up until the 6 district bossfight, and the final ""Shoot everyone"" mission. There is 6 districts where you do exactly the same, over and over and over : Talk to the 2 persons in charges of the operations, interogate a henchman for each that will tell you about all the things going on, then just destroy the targets (Driving vehicles, crates in warehouses) over and over and over again until you reach a ""Damage $"" threshold for both that unlocks the operation boss, which you can kill or capture. And then only, you can play the long-waited instanced district-boss mission, before doing the same 5 others times, and magically unlocking the bridge to the endgame.

TL;DR : Mafia III tried to be an open world game, but scrapped everything that contributed to it in Mafia II, leaving a blank, empty canvas with nothing to do than the EXACT. SAMES. MISSIONS. for the entierety of the game.
Also, [spoiler] Vito became a giant wuss with a death wish, that won't stand up for anything, even his own life, and will be fine living in misery[/spoiler]. And [spoiler] The girl ending is basicly muh strong empowered black women who don't need no boss that kills most of the country's criminal rings leader, and shots the governor until the Government cut off the city completely, and Kathrina turns it into ruins[/spoiler]

Pros: Great music, nice graphic details, charismatic characters, interesting side missions. Brutal kills can be awesome, also ending of more than few missions are so satisfying. Proper looking cars, proper music, it takes you back to the time after war in Vietnam. It has a nice story.
Cons: 
* Boring main missions. They are so repetitive. You beat up informer, kill enforcers, destroy mini bosses workplace, make them work for you, give districts to one of 3 of your under-bosses and game over.
* Story has nothing to do with mafia. This is GTA after war in Vietnam. Story is good, but it is not mafia story.
* Bugs! So many bugs made by the same guys who are asking now for 50$ for reworked Mafia I game. (Unable to pass true security in boxing mission, max 60 fps if you want to play with useless v-sync, unable to load from Full Screen - I had to load game window mode to pass first few videos before menu window where I would switch back to full screen again... so on)

69667516,76561198057378996,"After about 50+ hours of game time I finished the story as well as DLC(bonus points for giving all the base game owner DLC for free with release of Definitive Edition). There are some issues with the game as well as some straight up weird design choices, but that's what every game has, so all you can do is either get used to it or not play it, for me the pros outnumber cons by a mile.

Main issues the game has come from a couple of things, first being it's a console port, meaning graphical downgrade is thanks to our ""pals"" on consoles, which means any game that comes from there is going to look like crap unless it's basically remade again fro PC market, which sadly a lot of companies cannot do. The other set of issues comes from the fact that it's an open world game, and just like 99% of open world games it has filler content, which can feel very tedious and repetitive if you do it all in one go, instead you should mix and match that content so it feels fresh as you play.

Weird design choices I noticed that bothered me the most were concrete bushes/small trees, the fact that bulletproof vest is used if you're driving a car and hit something, or fall from a higher place, it's obviously an HP booster, but they masked it badly, and probably the worst one of all, ""invisible walls"" so to speak, areas of interest/mission areas are usually walled off, and there are spiked/barbed wire walls that cannot be crossed no matter what, which forces you to go through one of the few scripted entrances, it really makes replayability of said areas smaller as you're funneled to the entrances they wanted you to go through.

Story in the game is a classical tale of revenge, there are choices as well as different endings corresponding to how you played and what you chose. The game boils down to you taking over a district for one of the friendly mob groups and then moving forward to other districts so you can take them all down before striking the mob boss. It can and will feel repetitive if you just do these things without doing any of the side content in between, as it's a simple formula copy-pasted throughout the game, apart from main missions that take place usually after taking out a district. Now these missions and moments where your actions are followed by one of the songs included are really memorable, you get all pumped up and ready for action, and they are very well done.

There are collectibles, in fact, a lot of different ones, which don't count for any of the achievements but you will most likely want to get them all, as they're interesting, to say the least. Main categories consist of Playboy magazines, Vargas paintings(topless woman art), album covers(from the in game music, which is banger, authentic as well), propaganda posters, Hot Rod magazines and repent magazines.

Downloadable content brought in different items as well as mechanics, one of them has you investigating cultist areas, the other brings you to a tropical island so you can take back the nuclear warhead from the terrorists and the last one sends you to free the people who racist sheriff and his cops are harassing and killing. They're fairly short but now that we got them for free I can't complain.

If you like open world games you'll probably like this, there are no other games with the same setting as far as I know so that's a big plus too, you'll get a lot for your money if you're willing to ""grind"" for it, as even the main story will take you a while to do.",1590242932,1590796951,1,0.5702022314071655,5976,1020,1591385570,"{""recommendationid"": ""69667516"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198057378996"", ""num_games_owned"": 5044, ""num_reviews"": 557, ""playtime_forever"": 5976, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1020, ""last_played"": 1591385570}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""After about 50+ hours of game time I finished the story as well as DLC(bonus points for giving all the base game owner DLC for free with release of Definitive Edition).

This game could have been so much more with another year of development.  The city itself provides a great canvas for something special but the opportunity gets squandered.  First off, the city is inhabited by lifeless NPC zombies who show no semblance that they are doing their own thing  or are aware of their surroundings (watchdogs and watchdogs 2 provide better examples of how your NPC characters should behave  in a city imo).   Enemy and friendly a.i. (Like in Stones DLC or with the hit squad perk) is flat out atrocious.  They are so dumb that they barely provide resistance  as enemies or assistance as support.  They don't know how to utilize cover or tactics very well nor do they value their lives.  In the Stones DLC I died multiple times trying to revive A.I. Donovan because he would stand out in the open like an idiot and/or shoot in the wrong direction entirely providing no help.  The graphics are nothing to write home about either for the most part as textures often appear muddy and unrefined no matter the setting with suspect lighting and a terrible day/night transition (A modder created a reshade file that made the game look much better than out of the box which I give the devs zero credit for ).

When I heard they were making a ""Definitive Edition"" I held out hope  they would use that opportunity to fix some of these issues but it appears they did absolutely nothing but include all the DLC.  No noticeable graphical enhancements.  Zero A.I. /NPC improvements(IMO the games biggest fault).  No additions like a desperately needed fast travel system.   Nothing!  Truly a missed opportunity for this game to right some of it's wrongs.

Now it appears that 2k have done another update but not advertised it. i still cant run the game at optimal spec, but it no longer displays the message that my computer doesnt have the minimum spec, nor does it need to be run at graphics setting = potato. I would love to recommend this game as i am really beginning to get back in the game, i really feel the characters and story works and that LClay is a genuinely believable character... but... its taken them this long to fix a problem, which they didnt advertize as fixed, it still has to be run at less than medium spec for playable visuals. look, 2k, i did this with wolfenstien new order; if there was a maybe button i would press it, as it was, i paid more than i should have for a broken game which has since been fixed. i havent yet touched the added content and the fact i never opted in to the definitive version makes me think it wasnt worth the bother of the huge download. whatever. see below for original 2 reviews.


This top bit is an update, but it doesn't make much difference. The game is still a negative.
After receiving a series of emails from 2k, which did not address any issues with the game, and throughout they thought i was complaining about problems with a different game, i uninstalled this game. After seeing that a patch had been released i thought i would give it another chance. I was wrong. NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED. If you view the min spec requirements before the update which caused all the problems, it is compatible with my spec. i could run the game at decent settings, and now it wont run at playable speed even with the graphics set to ""POTATO"". On the whole i am incredibly disappointed, not only with the promise of a potentially fulfilling game, but with the devs lack of concern when addressing their consumers. There are a number of positive reviews of this game which seem dubious, and none make mention of the game killing update. some guy has over 2000 hours logged. Either he plays no other game, ever, since release, or they are spam reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FIXED YET.

Well it seems like everyone else here has had the same problem as me. I had the game running just fine, just completed the first big mission in the wierd voodoo theme park, then when i went to play again i discovered a MASSIVE 20 odd GB update and now, ""oh nice, i have definitive edition"" becomes ""Oh **** i have a game which is now UNPLAYABLE"". i had it running at optimal settings, it now wont even run at the lowest. if a games developer is going to put in a MASSIVE update like this, they should allow people with systems older than 6 months, to opt out of such unwanted things.

I would love to recommend this game as i am really beginning to get back in the game, i really feel the characters and story works and that LClay is a genuinely believable character... but... its taken them this long to fix a problem, which they didnt advertize as fixed, it still has to be run at less than medium spec for playable visuals. look, 2k, i did this with wolfenstien new order; if there was a maybe button i would press it, as it was, i paid more than i should have for a broken game which has since been fixed. i havent yet touched the added content and the fact i never opted in to the definitive version makes me think it wasnt worth the bother of the huge download. whatever. see below for original 2 reviews.\n\n\nThis top bit is an update, but it doesn't make much difference. The game is still a negative.\nAfter receiving a series of emails from 2k, which did not address any issues with the game, and throughout they thought i was complaining about problems with a different game, i uninstalled this game. After seeing that a patch had been released i thought i would give it another chance. I was wrong. NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED. If you view the min spec requirements before the update which caused all the problems, it is compatible with my spec. i could run the game at decent settings, and now it wont run at playable speed even with the graphics set to \""POTATO\"". On the whole i am incredibly disappointed, not only with the promise of a potentially fulfilling game, but with the devs lack of concern when addressing their consumers. There are a number of positive reviews of this game which seem dubious, and none make mention of the game killing update. some guy has over 2000 hours logged. Either he plays no other game, ever, since release, or they are spam reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FIXED YET.\n\nWell it seems like everyone else here has had the same problem as me. I had the game running just fine, just completed the first big mission in the wierd voodoo theme park, then when i went to play again i discovered a MASSIVE 20 odd GB update and now, \""oh nice, i have definitive edition\"" becomes \""Oh **** i have a game which is now UNPLAYABLE\"". i had it running at optimal settings, it now wont even run at the lowest. if a games developer is going to put in a MASSIVE update like this, they should allow people with systems older than 6 months, to opt out of such unwanted things.

Gameplay loop was repetitive but it wasn't nothing that big of a deal if you played any of the bigger block buster open-world titles like recent Assasin's Creed. This is nothing that you would be angry about. Be warned AI of your enemies in this game is so stupid. Played the game on medium difficulty setting and could've play it as well on hard. Most of the times you can easily funnel waves of enemies into one entrance and mow them down with ease. If you go about silent approach to cleaning up areas of enemies that you have to conquer you can do it easily with throwing knives and no one is the wiser, apart from maybe the last guy in his office where he chats with his subordinate (which he sometimes shoots bcs of quarrel and being on the edge). Don't worry about driving recklessly around cops/cop cars - as long as you don't crash into other cars or run over people you are golden. 
The atmosphere is great and one liners being thrown about or the things that happened during that game time felt like a interactive Quentin Tarantino movies.

 OST is amazing and gets you into the mood of after/during vietnam war times. And for me personally that's one of the pillars that make a game memorable. On this point they delivered.
Graphic wise it looks alright to get the job done. I come from times where gameplay and story was much more important while graphic fidelity gaps were filled by your imagination. Not that these graphics lack that much. So this is ok.
Gameplay is enjoyable. Shooting people, driving cars and your interaction with the environment (albeit indestructible stonewall bushes that you can crash your car over with can kick you out of immersion quicker than angry parents waking up to find out that you are still sitting in front of your PC at 4 in the morning and you have some important school stuff to do in few hours - let he who is without sin cast the first stone :P) is alright. 
Story is OK I guess. A circle of we're getting there to millions, we are betrayed and need to have revenge.

Don't know why ppl are angry about it being a shit game. I liked it. Game crashed about 5 times throughout the full playthrough (which took about 42 hours). Had to reload to last checkpoint from time to time when approaching a quest giver bcs they wouldnt react to bumps/talking interactions or sometimes the animations for characters that were to do something around lincoln didnt kick in but simple load last checkpoint (which 100% times was just before the thing that didnt work in the first place) fixed it for me. I guess I must be one of those guys that seem to have a rather stable setup that works well and don't give me any grief.
 
I wish there was graded and more complicated scoring system rather than bland 0 / 1 that steam has now. 
By any means everything I've written down in here is my personal opinion and taste. I've enjoyed my time with this game and if you like games about driving cars, shooting bad guys and being a sort of anti-hero but with his own moral compass/value system/things that drive you forward this a title for you. If you like GTA this game will be like getting into a cheaper version of your favourite ""go to town"" boots that you will probably use to do stuff around your garden or home and will not have many/almost any qualms about.

TL;DR - This is a cheap GTA game that has it's flaws, lacks diamond shine polish but it's not a bad game. IT's a Average to Good title. Strong 7 out of 10. But not by standards currently employed by $hit ""journalist"" scale that were bought and paid for. I'm talking about common sense and logic driven scale. Without any bias of any sort, I've bought it for myself on sale. Be smart with your expenses and life choices, buy it on sale (like everything else) and never pre order stuff. Read reviews, watch somegameplay, ask about opinions  of other ppl and then decide. But most of all never ever get swayed by the mass telling you what to think or how to feel about stuff. Decide for yourself. 

P.S. Thing that I really wonder about :
WTF did that almost 15 GB definitive edition update added to the game? I've turned it the game after update and no visible changes (5 min check). Graphic wise it changed literallly nothing for me. And I've played it on high quality settings.
I want a list of things added/modified like a patch log. Smells like a bad cash grab, just place a new sticker on top of the old title and sell the same dated stuff with a newly released game price tag. Something smells fishy in here.

P.S.2 : This game has NO MOTORCYCLE DRIVING of ANY sort. In fact there are no bikes, motorbikes or anything like that anywhere in the game (or maybe there is something like that standing as a easter egg or I've just missed it whilst it was standing like a barn in the middle of grass field... but oh well).
Feels bad man. Wanted to put that MC club attire and drive around on my indian chief while being a bad ass. But no bueno.

But most of all never ever get swayed by the mass telling you what to think or how to feel about stuff. Decide for yourself. \n\nP.S. Thing that I really wonder about :\nWTF did that almost 15 GB definitive edition update added to the game? I've turned it the game after update and no visible changes (5 min check). Graphic wise it changed literallly nothing for me. And I've played it on high quality settings.\nI want a list of things added/modified like a patch log. Smells like a bad cash grab, just place a new sticker on top of the old title and sell the same dated stuff with a newly released game price tag. Something smells fishy in here.\n\nP.S.2 : This game has NO MOTORCYCLE DRIVING of ANY sort. In fact there are no bikes, motorbikes or anything like that anywhere in the game (or maybe there is something like that standing as a easter egg or I've just missed it whilst it was standing like a barn in the middle of grass field... but oh well).\nFeels bad man. Wanted to put that MC club attire and drive around on my indian chief while being a bad ass. But no bueno.\nDevs add some bike riding to your next game (or even to this one :P).

After all the negative reviews the whole world put together for MAFIA III, decided to give the game a try. The developers have solved pretty much all the 'glitches' and 'technical issues'. 

Personally did not experience any trouble. 

As far as the game is concerned - THE STORY IS MAGNIFICENT. 

The main character, Lincoln, feels like an aggressive bull with Agent 47-Like stealth abilities (IMO). Yes, missions and objectives do feel similar but the versatility is in your own hands - YOU can choose different approaches - STEALTH, SNIPING, GUN-FIGHTS etc for every mission/task. 

Its an open-world Crime Shooter, so if you expect it to be similar to GTA with next-level attention to detail, it wont be. If you liked MAFIA II, you will love this too. Different districts with signature rackets (giving you insight into the crime world of 1960's America), Side missions that increase your earning abilities & emotionally dense story missions - Taking over the city one-by-one feels really rewarding.

69527811,76561198087361375,"Despite the fact I'm persisting with this game, I don't recommend anyone purchase this in its current state.

Having bought the original MAFIA III, was quite happy with the game so far. However the forced ""upgrade"" to the Definitive Edition has actually been a step backwards. A 25% drop in frame rates and graphical glitches have made this a frustrating experience. The only reason I am persisting with this title is that I'm so deep into the game, but if you're thinking of buying this game, even on sale, please reconsider until there are updates that fix these issues. 

As for the game itself, its fun but incredibly repetitive. The characters you have to take out are forgettable, along with their stores and the mission structure goes as follows:

* Meet with someone to start mission
* Take out a couple of hench men at a few sites
* Visit a few sites and either rob them or destroy their stash of whatever it is.
* Once you've done the above, the boss location will unlock where you have to kill them

Every single mission is structured this way. 

Furthermore, there's no real upgrade system and no ability to see stats. Therefore the game lacks depth and to be honest, once I complete I'll probably never play it again.

tl;dr - Don't buy this until there's a patch/fix. And even so, buy it if you're extremely bored as its inferior and repetitive in many ways.

After this game got a small update to Defintive Edition, there is no fixes for this game. Only thing i notice is, season pass is free for Mafia 3 Original owners but it's useless to me since i didn't finish the main game and i am not going to because how mess this game is !! 
This is worst AAA game i've ever played. RIP 2K CZECH. Hangar 13 is a joke and i'll never buy anything from this company! 
Glad i didn't pre order this game, i was very close to pre-order it and gladly i waited for user reviews. 
I bought this game years later from Humble Bundle (good deal), i should have sell the key. I didn't expect that this game is going to be very bad.

Edit: I gave another chance to this game and i finally finished this game. It's really badly optimized and 100% CPU when driving in big area. But honestly, the story is masterpiece and i enjoyed it a lot. Mini main missions are really boring, like it's repetitive and it got me bored fast. I had to rush when i've played these missions. Main missions are really good and enjoyable. But honestly AI is s h i t. I headshoted them when they were standing and hiding, it was too easy to kill them. And it's really buggy but mostly there are a lot of graphical bugs, i haven't seen any similiar bugs like falling out from map, being stuck or other bug missions (maybe only one and i had to restart checkpoint) and like anyone experienced this issue. Maybe they are fixed but i'm not sure. 
Still, this game isn't even worth $5, maybe it's worth for less money but it depends if u have a good computer, it won't be good on your shitty laptop that runs low requirements. It has to be above of your requirements.
Since Definitive Edition offered free DLC's, i don't fucking care. Also Ending was really good but still. I want 20-40s Mafia games and hopefully Mafia 1 Remake is going to be good.

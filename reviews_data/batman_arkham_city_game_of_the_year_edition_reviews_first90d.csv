The RPG (role playing game) outstood most of its competitors. From Warner Bros. Studios, Rock steady, NVidia, and DC comics this edition of Batman will blow the player away, literally. Based after the events in the 1st installment (Batman Arkham Asylum) Bruce Wayne has been captured and thrown into this new “asylum” that’s been built in the middle of the dangerous Gotham City. Bruce Wayne is also known as Batman (Kevin Conroy). The player discovers that the most treacherous villains are found within the secure walls of Arkham City. The Riddler (Wally Wingert), The Joker (Mark Hamill), Victor Zsasz (Danny Jacobs) and The Penguin (Nolan North) are just a few. A major event puts Batman’s life in jeopardy. Joker captures Batman in the Steel Mill and tells him an important factor. Rumors spread about Joker being ill. So, Batman investigates. Harley Quinn (Tara Strong) knocks Batman out cold and ties him up. This moment is the reason this game was captivating to us gamers. Batman says, “This was a lie, there is nothing wrong with you.” And Joker says, “You of all people should know there’s plenty wrong with me.” Grinning, the player notices his face is covered with scabs. He continues, “Take my blood for example, I wish somebody would, this stuff is KILLING ME!” While Joker laughs Batman says, “Why should I care?” and then Joker reveals “Because now there is a tiny bit of me inside of you, Bats!” Batman notices the IV and the blood going inside of his arm. To find a cure, it’s a race against the clock. While finding the cure, Batman also has to deal with a deadly plan called Protocol 10 ran by the man who built this place, Hugo Strange (Corey Burton). This amazing game will keep the gamer occupied for hours and hours because there are side missions, Riddler Trophies to collect, and campaign maps to verse other players on. The DLC (downloadable content) of the game also adds an element of surprise. For example, Harley Quinn’s Revenge was an anticipated mini story mode that’s based after the main story mode.

Spam: Very good looking action/puzzler, running on the fairly commonplace Unreal 3 + Scaleform combination. Combat and general controls are intuitive with a good learning curve, the ability to travel through a combination of grapple and glide, and operation of many BatGadgets™ becomes second nature extremely quickly.

Rocksteady have respected and observed much of the various comic and animated series' characters and events, but remain unafraid to plow ahead and do basically whatever they feel like, which is also good. There's a lot of replay value stemming from Campaign and Ranked challenge modes, as well as a metric fuckton of hidden collectibles.

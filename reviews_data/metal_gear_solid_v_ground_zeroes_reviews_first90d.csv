14915521,76561198004697637,"Before I get to the review, here’s some personal backstory:

I was born in early 1992 and grew up with a PlayStation, but I have never played a Metal Gear game before this one. The last stealth game I played (not including the Elder Scrolls games, because their stealth mechanics don’t count) was Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory on the Xbox, and that was released a decade ago (as of the writing of this review). I’ve heard a lot about the series, but it took a birthday gift from a close friend of mine to get Ground Zeroes (which I will abbreviate to GZ for the rest of this review).

I regret not buying this one release during the Steam Winter Sale; this game was awesome.

Unlike most AAA titles, GZ released on Steam with a $20 price tag (before the sale). This is because the game is essentially a tech demo to show off Hideo Kojima’s Fox Engine that will be used in The Phantom Pain (which I will abbreviate to TPP for the rest of this review). I never had any technical issues in the 27 hours running this game with my i5-4690K and my 280X, so it’s safe to say that this engine was incredibly well-made.

“Wait, you spent 27 hours in what you call a tech demo?”

There is only one story mission that will take even the newest of gamers no more than 2 hours to complete; it is a prologue to the events of TPP (not going to spoil anything). After you complete the story mission, you unlock a few “Side Ops” that have varying objectives. The open-world feel of GZ offers multiple ways for a mission to be complete (a quick search on YouTube would back me up on this). After you complete a mission, you’ll unlock the “Hard” difficulty for that mission as well as some gear to start with for that particular mission (granted you get a “C” Rank or better). Each mission also has a few optional objectives, most of them involving rescuing a prisoner or two.

The stealth mechanics, although not realistic, are definitely fun. Get too close in an enemy’s line of sight, and they’ll get suspicious and start searching the area for you. Stay in a camera’s lens for too long and the whole base knows exactly where you are. Sneak up too quickly behind a guy, and he’ll turn around and alert the base (which is the only map in the game, by the way; all missions have the same setting) unless you knock him out or kill him beforehand. Make sure you drag the bodies away, or their buddies will try to wake them up or alert the others if they find them. To assist in being sneaky, GZ allows you to “mark” an enemy, which essentially allows you to see them through obstructions granted you’re not moving or have the base on alert. You can also interrogate and disarm your foes to further help you in your missions. Explosives and even empty magazines can cause noise to divert your foes attention elsewhere while you sneak by.

Although you are aiming to avoid it, the combat in this game is well-done. There is CQC which allows you to knock out opponents in a cinematic way. Of course, there are also weapons such as a tranquilizer pistol, stun revolver, and your usual assortment of rifles and SMGs. You can toggle between third-person shooting and first-person shooting while aiming down the sights of your weapons. Certain weapons have attachments, such as silencers (which can break!) and lights to blind your foes.

What kept me playing this game were the collectibles and challenges, as well as a few hidden things. Completing a mission unlocks a challenge that you can do in the next play-through of that mission to unlock more challenges. These range from fastest marking of all enemies to fastest completion time and few other miscellaneous things. Steam keeps these records that you can look up and compare with your friends or with the rest of Steam.

I most certainly enjoyed my first Metal Gear experience, and this definitely won’t be the last. Now I remember why I liked Splinter Cell so much when I was younger and I think it’s time for me to be more invested in stealth games. I do want to go back and play the Metal Gear series from the beginning, but I have too much in my library to catch up on.

Also, I probably missed reviewing some parts of GZ. I’ll edit this as I figure that out.

You cannot change keybindings and it's a crappy console-port with no story. I don't know if it's better on PS4, but I played the PC-Version. You have to Press 1 or 3 to go forward or back in the menu and you can't use the mouse in the menu either.

Steam-Overlay isn't working and so you didn't have the option to take screenshots, too.

Ah well here is some information for everyone sense reviews go here.

-Does not play like MGS 1,2, & 3 (not sure on four haven't played it.)
-Controls for a PC 360 controls do not act like the classic controls so had to re-learn them
-Game is a pre-story for the Phantom pain coming out in September.
-Game is really short, seriously I think the world record is ten minutes now.
-Its not David voice acting Snake
-No seriously, It is a really freaking short game.

The fact that the difficulty is balanced around your gear and thus there's no time spent grinding for materials you then would use for hundreds of statistical upgrades makes this a lot better game than PP.

Did this a few times, and after piling up 40 dead bodies, called in the extraction chopper, right in front of the C3 since I was too lazy to find a safe spot, in the freaking middle of the base.

- Very good port.
- Great combination between Stealth action and ""Semi-sandbox"". You can choose the way to finish mission. More replayable.
- Very good Prologue. Cassettes make me chilling....
- Graphic likes Movie.
- Difficult enough to makes you crazy (if you choose CQC only way lol)

The Bad:
- Sometime AI has ""super vision"" can see us through the wall.... and AI has some stupid acts.

It all quite clearly serves a purpose now, and gets back to the gameplay rather than mess about too much out of gameplay once it has actually started.

Gameplay has changed too, with the scale of undetected to caught being more progressive. There's no more binary states for these, and the level genuinely is huge and expansive. So not only do you have plenty of places to go to try to evade chasing guards, but any guards who come to help their friends will actually travel from their post elsewhere on the map to do so rather than just spawn in when it's convenient for them. Everything's more intuitive and eloquent simply because it all occurs organically.

And the big point everyone fixates on; length. It's short, but remember it's not full price. And the extra missions on the side will keep you busy with their twists and changes to the gameplay even if they're not canon. I magnified my time in the main mission in these side/extra ops several times over. And that's the whole point of Ground Zeroes being separate too; It's so we can see how MGS5 gameplay works in advance of the full game. And it's all there. We get a taste of how sneaking gameplay works, more combat oriented gameplay, vehicle sections, and it all works really well.

14499960,76561197963922976,"This game is a massive shift in tone compared to the other Metal Gear Solid games. 

I’m not commenting on the gameplay, I want to comment on the story. I’m also not commenting on whether the price justifies the amount of content. These have been covered in other reviews. My main topic here hasn’t.

This is not a combination of the serious and the silly that you usually see in a Metal Gear Solid game. This game is very violent. I had trouble watching some of the cut scenes. I also gave up on listening to the extra tapes you get as rewards for completing missions because of how devastating they were emotionally. I am a fan of the series. I have played 1 to 4 and Peacewalker and enjoyed each one for their gameplay and their ability to broach sensitive or important or esoteric topics with a large degree of skill. 

One of the great things about Metal Gear Solid is that characters have pasts. There have always been disturbing elements in MGS, but they have usually been related to you through a character. This means that, in some sense, the very act of the character telling you a story of a disturbing event in their past allow a character to demonstrate a degree of autonomy and decision making. When a character describes their past they demonstrate awareness of both the event and how it impacted their thoughts and actions.  In other words, the way in which an event is described reveals something about both the event, and a characters current motivations. This provides context to the event, and also serves to prevent a spectacle.

 This game gives you the spectacle by showing you an event and not having it mediated through the character that is experiencing it. In fact, this game seems to go out of its way to remove context and character autonomy by not even allowing characters to comment on the events or their own motivations. 

All you are left with is a horrifying spectacle devoid of context or purpose beyond its own enjoyment. 

So if you enjoy horrifying spectacles and extreme emotional reactions then this is the game you want to play. In this respect it is very well made. It would have taken a lot of skill to do this. Otherwise, if you want something with a story or tone that was in the vein of previous MGS games you may want to atleast be aware that it might be different to what you are expecting. I personally found it too extreme, which is why I don’t recommend it. 

P.S I realise I may be in a minority here. Nonetheless I include this review because there is bound to be someone out there who would like a metaphorical speed bump to prevent them from speeding headlong into this without some kind of warning.

14483991,76561197998394233,"first off, i am, like so many others, not recommending this game due to its limited scope.  is it fun? yes. is it worth 20 bucks? not really.  i am not exactly disappointed, since i knew what to expect, but this game doesnt really tide me over while waiting for the phantom pain either.  metal gear solid 4 is one of my favorite games of all time by the way.

14360970,76561198030069520,"This game was the first MGS game that I've ever played, but I was very interested in the game ever since I saw the first trailer video for Phantom Pain, so I read up on the story before Ground Zero came out(Bought it on PS4). I really like this game, true there isn't that much gameplay to the main mission, but lots of side missions to do. But what really captivated me was the story overall, after lots of hours researching the story. 

Graphics are great, superb animations, sounds/music, Ai. Like many in the other reviews keep saying, the Ai is amazing, how they react to certain situations is just astonishing.

If you haven't played any MGS before, and know nothing about the story, I'd say it doesn't really matter, I guess it just makes more sense if you know, but you get the gist from the dialogue in the game. Save the targets, save the day. 

SPOILER!!: When I was playing the game, I was really impressed by the dialogue of the characters, graphics, animations, everything was great. However I never really found anything special about the game, until I came to the tortured Paz. Nothing really special about it, torture in games happens often, however when I found these ""Tapes"" of the torture it just became SO MUCH more feeling to the whole thing. The sounds of Paz being tortured, raped and all kinds of sick stuff. Now that is something I wasn't used to see in games, a much darker side of the story, more detail. I really wanted to kill ""Skull Face"" or whatever his name is, after these tapes.

I really like this game, true there isn't that much gameplay to the main mission, but lots of side missions to do. But what really captivated me was the story overall, after lots of hours researching the story. \n\nGraphics are great, superb animations, sounds/music, Ai. Like many in the other reviews keep saying, the Ai is amazing, how they react to certain situations is just astonishing.\n\nIf you haven't played any MGS before, and know nothing about the story, I'd say it doesn't really matter, I guess it just makes more sense if you know, but you get the gist from the dialogue in the game. Save the targets, save the day. \n\nSPOILER!!: When I was playing the game, I was really impressed by the dialogue of the characters, graphics, animations, everything was great. However I never really found anything special about the game, until I came to the tortured Paz. Nothing really special about it, torture in games happens often, however when I found these \""Tapes\"" of the torture it just became SO MUCH more feeling to the whole thing. The sounds of Paz being tortured, raped and all kinds of sick stuff. Now that is something I wasn't used to see in games, a much darker side of the story, more detail. I really wanted to kill \""Skull Face\"" or whatever his name is, after these tapes. It was really messed up, but gave so much more feeling to the game and if Phantom Pain has anything unexpected like this, I will be such an amazing game.\n\nOverall I like the game, one of the best of 2014, even though it's short, unless you go for 100% completion, then it's quite a long game for the price.

[olist]
    [*]Gameplay [9/10] - Probably the best Tactical Espionage game I have played until now. The Game Mechanics, The A.I, The openess in how you approach your Mission objectives. It's all top notch, I don't know about others but whoever did the porting of this game did a damn good job if you ask me. This is after all how a Port should be done and the fact that this game is just a preview of what Phantom Pain will be - I am just speechless (No literally I can't speak anymore, need to go to a doctor).

    [*]Story [8.5/10] - Now I wish I could have given 10 or at least a 9 here in this but that would be cheating, after all I am trying to give a genuine review of this game. This individual story is quite good, you have everything that you need to know provided in the back-story and casette tapes. The cutscene directions, the wonderful voice acting - all has been done near to perfection. However when you play this game for the first time (Like me) - All I knew about Metal Gear was Snake - I didn't knew who was who and all that stuff and honestly speaking - it's not quite easy to get hold of it either unless of course, you're a die hard fan which I wasn't - so what about us. Maybe someone else will provide you with a different solution but mine is simple, watch the video series (The Link I provided above - it will bring you up to speed on the entire MGS lore) and once again that video series if for people who don't know much about the MGS Story or they are confused in some parts. That will surely help them, it surely helped me - Now I know everything about MG ^_^ (Boo Yea).

    [*]Total Score [9.5/10] - This game for me is value for money, it provides hours and hours of gameplay - I am 12 hours in game and I still have to collect a few of the achievements that are left. So overall you get at least - 5 hours of gameplay if you're a player who likes to rush through things and over 20+ hours - if you're an achivement hunter and a completionist. This game sets a very good stage for what's in store for us - Phantom Pain (The name sends a shiver down my spine), that game will be epic. I don't know what others will do with this game but for me it surely will be one Hell of an Epic game, for me it will be one of the best games of 2015.

14320797,76561198000387990,"I'm a huge Metal Gear Solid fan but I was skeptical about the port to steam since, let's face it, many console ports haven't made a smooth transition to pc as of late but Kojima definitely ensured a quality port that actually ends up feeling like its native platform was pc to begin with.

Mouse and keyboard support is spot on! the keys are mapped in a very intuitive way, keys are also stream lined so that several keys share different functions rather than having to contort a finger reaching for some ridiclous punctuation key. Most console ports have been plagued with mouse smoothing (which can't be disabled in some cases) but right from the get-gp the mouse is precise and responsive, unfortunately there is no mouse support in the menus but meh, that's really a small nit pick.

Anyone complaining that Ground Zeroes doesn't pack a lot of content is sorely mistaken. The main campaign takes at least an hour for skilled players to complete on normal difficulty (far more if you try to accomplish challenges and play on hard difficulty) plus there is a slew of side missions. All in all this ""demo"" as people call it can easily run you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay, which isn't too shabby for the price.

Haha all joking aside Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes is a prologue of sorts serving towards the upcoming highly anticipated Phantom Pain and this simply wet my appetite even more for the upcoming game and all the amazing potential it may have, if this one short ""demo"" had me addicted and invested until 100% completion imagine the main course?

Once again Mr Kojima has pulled it off with flying colors and while it may be simply be one medium sized map taking place on a Cuban blacksite it yearns to be replayed again in different variations of missions, collectables, and competitive rankings worldwide for who can do (the longes tranqualizer shot) best. 

Story: ""!WARNING some minor spoilers below, skip this section if you wanna come in clean not knowing anything""

In the aftermath of the Peace Walker incident, Paz Ortega Andrade is missing and presumed to be dead. Under the direction of Kazuhira Miller and Huey, Militaires Sans Frontières turn their attention to an upcoming inspection by the UN amid suspicions that they possess a nuclear weapon, which MSF believe to be an attempt by the Cipher organization to stifle them. Their preparations are interrupted when MSF agents in Cuba investigate reports that Paz survived and has been detained at Camp Omega. The situation is complicated when Ricardo ""Chico"" Valenciano Libre attempts to rescue her and is similarly captured. Believing that both of them could compromise MSF, Snake is sent to infiltrate Camp Omega and extract them if they are alive, or confirm that they are dead and if so, determine what they revealed to their captors. Snake also recognizes the value in rescuing Paz, as he believes doing so will convince Cipher to stand down while Paz will be more willing to discuss Cipher's activities with MSF. 
Everything in this story is mature and handles it maturely nothing is out of place or put there merely for ""shock value"" if you have knowledge of ""Peace Walker"" on psp or simply listen to the audio codecs you'll know it happens for a reason. HIdeo is a master at clever writing with ""double agents"", malignant organizations, and controversial topics to move the game industry forward as a whole into a work of art. 
The character conversations are deeply engrossing and I slightly teared when Big Boss first finds Chico. This game solidly earns it's M+ rating and wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 17 as there are depictions of extreme violence, torture, and gore.

Gameplay: The threat detection system is revamped, with the removal of the onscreen meter or gauge to indicate the player that they are in the 'alert/evasion/caution' state as in previous games, which have instead been replaced by visual and audio representations. Snake's binoculars have also been revamped; instead of selecting the binoculars as an item, the binoculars are hot keyed to a button. The player is able to mark enemies and be aware of their locations in the iDroid's holographic display. There are directional cues to help players when an enemy sees them from a distance and gets closer to them. A new ""Reflex Mode"" is activated when an enemy finds Snake and the player only has a short window of time (in slow motion) to take out the enemy before he fully sounds the alarm (a hissing audio cue can be heard if the player is detected by searchlight). Lights can be shot out to further aid the player's stealth efforts. 
Thats some of the new things that can be found in this latest iteration of the franchise, next up comes cqc and takedowns which for anyone who has played a mgs game in the past, more specifically ""Metal Gear Solid 3"" should be familiar with, although here it's expanded upon with guards being much more dynamic depending on the situation ahd the level of freedom to not being constrained to any one point in the base. Once you grab a guard in a chokehold there are a number of things you can do such as make them yell out for assistance to the nearest guard to take both of them out in one fell swoop, or perhaps interrogate him for information on locations with more weaponry? The number of ways to take on an obstacle deeply varied depending on your playstyle. Of course all the previously mentioned things such as ""reflex mode"" and third person shooting can be turned off for purists wanting the ultimate challenge.

Sound: The design, soundstage, voice-acting, original score, all work harmoniously this is top notch quality at work here the production value is through the roof for this game and they really have invested big into it to bring this game to life. From ambient sound such as the rain pitter patting down to the ground and changing when going indoors to a ""clunk"" on the metal roof. Or the plop of a boot walking through mud, it all puts you there in the moment for you to enjoy and completley immerse yourself into the experience. 

Guns sound top-notch more than likely recorded in a professional studio first hand; every bullet being fired off packs a punch into your ears and shells falling to the ground give off a distinctive sound, reloading a magazine sounds authentic snapping into place just right.
 
Now I know many of you have been complaining about the new voice actor Mr.Sutherland, while he may not be the original Snake voice we all know and love he gets the job done just fine, and rather adding some emotion into Big Boss's voice through sadness, shock, or humor all being translated well into the game. And subjectively speaking I rather like his new voice gives Big Boss some depth as opposed to the monotone and gruff voice that we use to have.

Graphics: Wow thats all I can say... wow, wow, wow. The best looks to performance ratio game I've played in years, the game is very well optimized and I regard it highly as one of the best running games I have ever played. I was able to crank everything up to it's maximum settings at 1080p with an older gtx 660ti while still running it at a smooth 45-60fps. Now thats what you call optimization, a large number of settings are there for you to tweak to your hearts content from lighting detail to ssao and special effects it's all there for the taking. Heck I was able to get this running on an old laptop at 720p and it still ran great at 30fps, looked really good too, so don't be afraid to buy this software for an older running machine.

The Fox Engine is really being utilized to it's full potential here, some-things in the game from research I've done has actually been laser-scanned into the game such as rocks and twigsto add on to the ground, cinematography effects as well, depth of field, bokeh, and yes the infamous lens flare are all used to great extent in this game giving it as always a signature kojima flair that adds to the mood of the game, very reminiscint of film effects. Facial expressions and character models are highly detailed with each wrinkle on snake's face telling a story of his past and expressing emotion depending on the situation. Animations are out of this world good, acting in realistic ways whenever shooting, falling, or choking someone out and motion capture quality I haven't seen since a little game called ""The Last Of Us"".

Conclusion: ""Half as long, twice as bright"". ""Short but sweet"". These are the words that come to mind when investing my hard earned money into this game and playing through it again and again, simply pumping me up and setting the  bar higher for other developers to topple, there is loads of content here, new easter eggs to discover and accomplishments to topple in a mission. Buy this game with peace in mind that you will enjoy it, I give it my personal recommendation to everyone and anyone who enjoys gaming! Although be forwarned this is a ""tactical espionage"" game take it nice and slow the less people alerted the better. 
I hope you enjoyed my review, and as always have a nice day.

Gameplay is excellent, felt really smooth and controls are straight away simple to pickup. I am a strong believer in quality over quantity, this game being a pure demonstration as to why. Everything has been well thought out, the story mode admittedly not long but provided great entertainment. I wasn't particularly excited about the idea of playing through just a prologue, but after completing it and seeing the story set up it just makes me want the full game now!

Side Ops and Extra Ops is a nice bonus, providing just that little bit more for us MGS lovers that wanted more before the final game is out. For people that have been worrying about the short storymode, check my hours for the game.

So, this game was a COMPLETE SURPRISE for me!
1. Sandbox that was made right - it is actually something between Thief2 (with it's huge locations) and Deus Ex:HR with it's variability. This is HUGE level up for this game series gameplay-wise.

2. Picture - one of the best picture in contemporarry games, esprcially characters. Therefore it is not very technological (if compare with something like RYSE) but due to excellent work of artists it looks even better. I also noticed that animation is very snooth and percise.
3. Story - of course it is mot much of it, bacause it is more demo than actual game but all what is presented by Kodjima now looks much more mature and stylish than before. Game says ""Hello"" to Emmanuel Lubezki with it's single shot cutscenes. Top notch directing.
4. PC version - another surprise - historically Japanese games have very poor PC ports with lots of problems, but this time it  is exeption. It even looks like it actually made for PC - good optimisation and comfortable controls - first time I REALLY enjoyed playin MGS game with keyboard and mouse!

14135434,76561198107340272,"2/10 

I could not recommend against this ""game"" more. It is a bad joke that this costs any amount of money at all. Unless of course, buying this ""game"" is like a down-payment on Phantom Pain and I will get a substantial discount (I'm thinking 80-90% is fair, considering what they will likely over-price it at) for suffering this short, yet exquisite agony of an unsatisfying purchase.

Rather than some big wall of text, I'll bullet-point pros and cons.

Cons:
              - It is a woeful console port, clearly PC was an afterthought for more $$$.
              - Related to the above, as such the movement is really clunky and non-intuitive, along with the controls. An example includes, instead of arrow buttons or (shock-horror) mouse clicks in the menus, one has to use the number keys 1 and 3. That's right, not 1 and 2; 1 and 3, making navigating the menus a chore.
             - There aren't even options to LOOK at what keys do what, never mind changing them. The only controls screen you can bring up has an image of an Xbox controller with no indication of where they keys correspond on the keyboard.
             - It is the least value for money I have ever seen in a game. For the price-point of $20, I would expect around-about 5 hours of story-related game-play (at a push) as this is generally the price and length of DLC of other triple-A titles.
             - I genuinely feel this should be a free demo for the limited content it offers.
             - Any ""extra"" missions you unlock are the same map at a different time of day, from a different angle and have the most token-istic objectives - ""Collect intel"", ""assassinate targets"" etc...basically a piss-poor version of the VR training we have seen in previous MGS, with nothing contributing to the storyline. The ""storyline"" gameplay of the game takes between 5-10 minutes to complete.
             - Kieffer Sutherland is not David Hayter. I'm sorry, it may seem silly, but Solid Snake/Big Boss is David Hayter...you can't go changing voice actors out. It's just not cricket.

Pros:
           - It really is a gorgeous-looking game.
           - However short this may have been, the storytelling was superb. Kojima is a fantastic film-maker, who uses the tools of videogames to tell a story. In the one mission it does have, I certainly felt like a f***ing bad-a** hero at one point (no spoilers).

Well done Hideo, you've lost a long-time fan of the series. I think I was about 10 when I first played MGS...I'm 22 now and left almost as disappointed as when I attempted to play Peace Walker on the, again, shoddy port to Xbox 360.

-Real physics
-Immersion, hear the soldiers sneeze, shoot the sh*t, talk about sensitive information, etc. Feel like you're in the sh*t for real, deep behind enemy lines.
-Completionists eat your heart out, tons of collectibles, and enough side missions and achievements to keep you occupied for a good length of time (gotta kill time till TPP somehow right?).

Cons:
-The main story mission is short. REALLY short.
-There's only one map/AO and its not that big.

14086638,76561198060821109,"So where to start with Ground Zeroes? I guess first off, I'm a fan of the MGS series as a whole, and that should certainly be a prerequisite for playing MGS:GZ. This would be a terrible starting (even though it's the first one released on PC) and is certainly not going to convince someone to love MGS if they weren't a fan before. But for those of us that enjoy the previous iterations, it's worth looking at.

The biggest caveat with this game though, is that it's crazy overpriced. You are basically paying $20 for a tech demo. I currently have 3.8 hours playtime, and that was more than enough time to complete the main mission and one of side missions, even though I took them very slowly and experimented with the mechanics rather than going for completion.

Maybe even more of an issue than the price, is how repetitive it is. $20 for a preview game with 6 missions wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pretty much all the same. The missions are all the same map, with just different objectives like rescue prisoners or sneak in and eliminate a target. Completing the missions basically means sneaking into the same base 5 times (plus 1 forced loud mission) to complete tasks that aren't really that different from each other. And if you want to complete everything, you then have to do them all again on Hard difficulty. I realize that repetition isn't completely out of character for MGS (it took at minimum of 12 playthroughs of MGS4 to unlock everything I believe), but this is even more apparent in MGS:GZ because it only consists of one short missions.

So far I've been pretty negative, but I'm also recommending the game, so I should elaborate on that. First off, the FOX engine looks incredible, and the visual presentation in this game is outstanding. I also really enjoyed the gameplay, which takes some of the better facets of MGS4 and builds on them. The enemy AI is also really fun to interact with. Here's a good example the complexity it presents. I shot out a camera at one point rather than going around it. But as soon as I did, a guard was dispatched to check it out. I hid in the area to see what happened, and sure enough, a guard came over to look at the camera. Not wanting him to report it in and set off an alarm, I tranqed him. But as I was sneaking over to his unconscious body to hide it, headquarters called his radio for a status update, and then triggered an alarm when he didn't respond. From my experience, you really have to adapt to the AI and you take a risk when you eliminate someone.

I play a lot of steath games (no kill, no alarm runs of DE:HR and Dishonored for example), and the stealth feels a little off here. Well, to be fair, it feels like MGS, but stealth games have evolved a bit since the last MGS release. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it's just different. After playing more recent stealth games, I was surprised at the lack of safe hiding places like the vents in DE:HR. This isn't a negative, but it is a different design and keeps you on your feet a bit more.

So all in all, I really liked the presentation and gameplay, but the total package here feels a bit lacking. I'll still recommend it though because most importantly, it got me really excited for MGS5, which is really the point of it's release.


*SPOILER*

I guess first off, I'm a fan of the MGS series as a whole, and that should certainly be a prerequisite for playing MGS:GZ. This would be a terrible starting (even though it's the first one released on PC) and is certainly not going to convince someone to love MGS if they weren't a fan before. But for those of us that enjoy the previous iterations, it's worth looking at.\n\nThe biggest caveat with this game though, is that it's crazy overpriced. You are basically paying $20 for a tech demo. I currently have 3.8 hours playtime, and that was more than enough time to complete the main mission and one of side missions, even though I took them very slowly and experimented with the mechanics rather than going for completion.\n\nMaybe even more of an issue than the price, is how repetitive it is. $20 for a preview game with 6 missions wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pretty much all the same. The missions are all the same map, with just different objectives like rescue prisoners or sneak in and eliminate a target. Completing the missions basically means sneaking into the same base 5 times (plus 1 forced loud mission) to complete tasks that aren't really that different from each other. And if you want to complete everything, you then have to do them all again on Hard difficulty. I realize that repetition isn't completely out of character for MGS (it took at minimum of 12 playthroughs of MGS4 to unlock everything I believe), but this is even more apparent in MGS:GZ because it only consists of one short missions.\n\nSo far I've been pretty negative, but I'm also recommending the game, so I should elaborate on that. First off, the FOX engine looks incredible, and the visual presentation in this game is outstanding. I also really enjoyed the gameplay, which takes some of the better facets of MGS4 and builds on them. The enemy AI is also really fun to interact with. Here's a good example the complexity it presents. I shot out a camera at one point rather than going around it. But as soon as I did, a guard was dispatched to check it out. I hid in the area to see what happened, and sure enough, a guard came over to look at the camera. Not wanting him to report it in and set off an alarm, I tranqed him. But as I was sneaking over to his unconscious body to hide it, headquarters called his radio for a status update, and then triggered an alarm when he didn't respond. From my experience, you really have to adapt to the AI and you take a risk when you eliminate someone.\n\nI play a lot of steath games (no kill, no alarm runs of DE:HR and Dishonored for example), and the stealth feels a little off here. Well, to be fair, it feels like MGS, but stealth games have evolved a bit since the last MGS release. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it's just different. After playing more recent stealth games, I was surprised at the lack of safe hiding places like the vents in DE:HR. This isn't a negative, but it is a different design and keeps you on your feet a bit more.\n\nSo all in all, I really liked the presentation and gameplay, but the total package here feels a bit lacking. I'll still recommend it though because most importantly, it got me really excited for MGS5, which is really the point of it's release.\n\n\n*SPOILER*\nI'd be remiss if I didn't call out the bomb scene.

What to say about this game?
I was reluctant to buy the game myself, after reading reviews saying how ""short"" the game was.
I received it as a Christmas present, but I can say now, I would have gladly bought it myself.
The game is as long as you want to make it.
I've played for 30+ hours now, and still keep finding things to do.

It's true, you can beat the main mission, pretty fast, depending on how you play.
If you go with a stealth aproach, the game gets that much harder, and in my opinion, that much more fun.

There are so many different ways to play.
You can go in all guns blazing, but that'll usually end up getting yourself killed.
When the ""Ground Zeroes"" mission is completed, you'll unlock ""Side Ops"" missions.
There are two ""Extra Ops"" missions which must be unlocked, but I'll let you figure out how to unlock those yourself.
It becomes addicting trying to achieve an S rank on all the missions.
With each rank, you'll unlock rewards, for the mission.
Higher ranks, unlock the lower rank rewards.
So, if you get an S rank, you'll get the rewards for S, A, B, C, and so on.
I'm still trying to achieve an S rank on all missions, on normal and hard difficulty.

I've replayed every mission several times through.
Each time I learn a new way to get through the mission faster, and new ways to take out the guards.
You'll get very used to the little patch of land, as every last mission takes place in the same area.
It sounds bad on paper, but it actually works out very well.
Things are changed enough, to keep you on your toes.
As you grow accustomed to the area, it makes getting through the missions that much easier.
If you don't explore, and simply do what the mission guidelines state, you'll be missing out on a lot.
I played one mission 4 times, only to realize the 5th time through when I was goofing around, there was more to the mission.
Make sure to try and interegate as many guards as you can, through-out all the missions.

I could say a whole lot more, but I don't want to spoil anything.

14062970,76561198055615140,"An excellent introduction to the latest installment of the Metal Gear Solid series. As with it's predecessors, Metal Gear Solid is at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of gaming, constantly re-invnting itself and tackling real world themes such as war, love, hate, genetics and fate. 

This prelude, whilst might put some peope off for the length of the story mode will be suprised to find enormous relayability and longavity due to the extra content included, such as side operations and collectables and secrets. 
The game is a sort of ""hat-tip"" to fans of the series and gives player's the chance to feel out the final game the Phantom Pain will become. 

As gameplay goes, the controls are intuitive and fluid and extremly smooth for a PC port. The map is open-ended and missions can be accomplished in any manner you wish.
An example:- You are tasked with destroying three targets on the map. You Begin at a pre defined location and how you enter the base is down to the player. You can sneak through, becoming a ""phantom"" place the explosives and get out without anyone knowing you were even there. Alternatively, you can crack open an armoury and blow through the targets with a rocket launcher. You will alert everyone to your presence and present yourself with greater risk etc. 

There are some downsides to the game especially on PC. Without a decent setup, you will encounter a few crashes and framerate issues. This however is constantly being monitered and sorted by the developer who are working round the clock to fix these gripes. 
Additionally from a story perspective, whilst the game does include a backstory diary and a ""previously on Metal Gear"" menu, it does little to introduce players to the overall story so if you are a newcomer, you will play this game not knowing what a Cypher is, exactly who Kazuhira Miller is and generally being a bit lost. A suggestion would be to pick up a copy of the HD collection (or the Legacy collection) and book the week off work and enjoy a fantastic and gripping storyline that would leave Chris Nolan's eyeballs spinning. 

Overall. A fantastic game if you are a fan of the Stealth/Action Genre and a must-own for any fan of the series.

I love the Metal Gear franchise and this game is no exception. It is also essentially a demo that costs money, but damn was it a glorious demo.

14049236,76561198015152844,"GG, had plenty of fun BUT here's what imo requires improvement (in case devs read those):
- draw distance is too short (there is a mission where it is enough to shoot a barrel to complete objective but sadly you have to walk close enough to see it)
- DoF gets out of hand at times
- mouse movement does not scale when using zoom on binoculars or riffles which makes aiming clunky
- a bit too easy to sneak around enemies at close range 
- not every sound alerts guards - like closing doors or screaming hostages
- hard mode is too easy - there should be no cqc/less ammo/less hp/obligatory no enemy marking
- some weird key assignments that cannot be changed (P to play recording? why not space or enter?)
- I'm not a fan of the story, but meh.. whatever

It's only a single map with a few missions but it's possible to approach them in various creative ways. I have 20h on record and still I see people on yt making things I had no idea were possible. Buy it if you like sneaking of any kind.

The story is amazing, and packed with fan-service. It is a great way to finally see how Big Boss became the person he is.The sound, and quality of cutscenes is excellent.

This game does similar things like FarCry4 in which you can mark enemies to give you awareness of your surroundings, but in this game you also have the third person view which makes sneaking around so much easier. Its clear that the designers focused a lot on making the controls more intuitive. In tense firefights the controls flow seemlessly never taking you out of the action. 

But if youve never played MGS, the crowning achievement for the franchise is sound. Realistic weapons having realistic sounds in different environments emerses you into the role of being a one man army. This new MGS delivers that in a big way. The sound and music puts you into the game better than any game ive ever played.

13991069,76561198005547215,"I have recently played through the main Metal Gear Solid Games and also played Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. A great series with great characters, great story, great atmosphere, music, graphics, and gameplay. Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes is the latest in the MGS series and serves as a prologue to Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain.
 
Ground Zeroes is a cheap, smaller game than what the Phantom Pain will offer. This is both a strength and a weakness for the game as it's very short. However, the game offers a large open area to experiment with the new mechanics and weapons. Metal Gear Solid 5 marks the series going open world in level design. Just from Ground Zeroes' big level, it gives me a lot of optimism for the Phantom Pain's open world levels which will be even bigger. 

However, here's the problem with the game and why people are flipping out about it. The game is just a few missions in one level. Only one mission is the prologue to the Phantom Pain and can be finished in about an hour or two depending on how you approach the level. The mission is really good and you get to really get a feel for the new mechanics which will be fleshed out even further in the main game. It's a good mission but it ends too fast and you feel  a little cheated and ripped off (I paid 13 bucks during the sale so it's not too bad for that price and there are people who spent 30 bucks). The game has a few missions after the main mission and they are fun for the most part and reach new levels of campiness. If you noticed from my play time, I found ways to extend my playtime and have a blast. I'm only about 40% done with the total progress too so there's a lot more for me to do such as all the Hard modes and getting S ranks on all the missions. There's a lot to do for a small game and if you are a Metal Gear fan, you will have fun with the Deja Vu mission and Raiden mission which are bundled for free in the PC version.

Graphically, Ground Zeroes looks amazing, especially in the main mission and the late afternoon missions. It also is a solid (No pun intended) port that is scaleable on all kinds of hardware. This is all because of the FOX engine which looks and runs incredibly well and looks nearly photorealistic. Some of the settings are tough to run but I played on some Extra High and High settings and got 60fps throughout. It's amazing that Kojima Productions made such a good port despite their long break from PC porting. It's a shame more devs aren't putting this kind of effort into their games on PC (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). 

Overall, Ground Zeroes is a great sub-game to give you a taste of what the Phantom Pain will be like.

After the very short main mission, there are all these ""Side Ops"" (other missions in the same setting) to play which is nice. Not to mention, Metal Gear Solid fits pretty well in a large area. I wouldn't call it ""sandbox"", but there's plenty of room for roaming around and trying new tactics.

Now the bad: As a long time Metal Gear Solid, I now officially hate Kiefer Sutherland. It may be a small detail in the larger picture, but removing David Hayter as the voice of Snake is blatantly offensive to the ears. It's jarring. Snake feels like a stranger now.

Do you feel lucky? 
Huh?
I mean, do you like Metal Gear Solid? 
Did  u enjoy previous Kojima productions, shed a tear at snake eater ending, and spend days reading about the story online? If the answers to previous questions were yes, im glad youre feeling lucky and u should get this game. The main mission on first try is about 2-3 hours of top notch stealth action quality gaming, with amazing cutscenes, bloody and dark themes  (seriously, this might not be a game for everyone), great voice acting and everything MGS has always been. With all the lighting effects, sharp textures and fluid animations sometimes it's hard to belive its not rendered CGI . With addtional side ops, easter eggs, ranking system, the replayability is quite high, no to mention story itself was designed in such a way that in order to fully grasp it u have to  do multiple playthroughs and search for cassetes.

I was not happy about the pricing at the beginning (even with the drop) but now the game is at a good price and is a good opportunity to have a 4k legacy version (this PC version).

It's a achievement based game (if you like that). So if take this as a 6 mission VR training game and you want to complete it at 100% you'll enjoy it. I find myself playing it a lot the last year.

Also I wanna mention that the game has one main cannon mission ""Ground Zeroes"" and it's very very short and not very rewarding in story terms but is there.

FOX Engine looks nice, and works good on PC too (after a one year delay it was mandatory to have a good ""port"". Sorry it is not but a port but is the first game on PC with this Engine working OK...PES 2014...:V ).

13968203,76561197990899902,"First of all if you're just looking for a linear story experience then buy something else, this is not the cutscene heavy go from point a to point b typical metal gear game.

If you can get over that and actually adapt to the new gameplay style you will vastly enjoy this game and get more than your money's worth. This is a game about exploration and experimentation. There is one main mission and six side missions, two of which are unlockable. If you just go through the missions just to beat them you'll probably get 4-5 hours of content, possibly more depending on how long it takes you to tackle those missions. 

The real meat of the game is experimenting with the new fox engine and how to tackle those missions. For example there is a side mission where you have to assassinate two targets, now you can just go and kill them, you can go and grab a sniper rifle and take them out from a distance to more easily escape, you can extract both of the targets by chopper to get more information, it's up to you.

There's also prisoners and hidden secrets in every mission and context sensitive events that can be uncovered and triggered. All of these hidden secrets are the main story of this game. If you want to understand why certain characters act a certain way during the main game or what happened before you got there you have to uncover the tapes, they also potentially reveal information about The Phantom Pain. There's also XOF patches to find to unlock the two extra missions as well as unlockable weapons that can be placed at the starting point of each mission.

The gameplay is amazing in this game, with the addition of open world gameplay you have no radar so you have to mark and pay attention to enemies, there are such small details added that affect gameplay like the difference in knockout time between choking a guard, tranquilizing a guard and punching out a guard, how long a guard will stay asleep in a dark area versus a sunny area and other features.

As a PC port of a console game this is one of the best PC ports I've ever played, there are so many customization options and it has been optimized perfectly and the controls are excellent with the exception of no mouse control in menus.

This is a game about exploration and experimentation. There is one main mission and six side missions, two of which are unlockable. If you just go through the missions just to beat them you'll probably get 4-5 hours of content, possibly more depending on how long it takes you to tackle those missions. \n\nThe real meat of the game is experimenting with the new fox engine and how to tackle those missions. For example there is a side mission where you have to assassinate two targets, now you can just go and kill them, you can go and grab a sniper rifle and take them out from a distance to more easily escape, you can extract both of the targets by chopper to get more information, it's up to you.\n\nThere's also prisoners and hidden secrets in every mission and context sensitive events that can be uncovered and triggered. All of these hidden secrets are the main story of this game. If you want to understand why certain characters act a certain way during the main game or what happened before you got there you have to uncover the tapes, they also potentially reveal information about The Phantom Pain. There's also XOF patches to find to unlock the two extra missions as well as unlockable weapons that can be placed at the starting point of each mission.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing in this game, with the addition of open world gameplay you have no radar so you have to mark and pay attention to enemies, there are such small details added that affect gameplay like the difference in knockout time between choking a guard, tranquilizing a guard and punching out a guard, how long a guard will stay asleep in a dark area versus a sunny area and other features.

In my mind this is a complete return to what made MGS 1-3 so fantastic. 4, while great in it's own way, was largely a playable movie with a bit of gameplay thrown in. Ground Zeroes has almost as much gameplay as 4 if you do all of the side missions and challenges so don't believe the rumors that there isn't much to this. Replayability is huge, take the time to train for Phantom Pain with some of the new features, because I found about a dozen ways to beat each mission and had an absolute blast doing it.

The ambience, gun control, stealth mechanics and general visual appeal of Ground Zeroes was near flawless for me. I love stealth games in general with MGS being my all time favorite franchise so I can be very picky about how it's done.

I'd love to see a little bit more consideration given to challenge timers for those of us who feel the need to kill enemies now and then.

I've played all the Metal Gear games and I have to say the way they are going with the new games is amazing. It's now an open world where every time you play is different. Do whatever you want, take on the mission any way you want. Unlike with other games where they changed things and totally lost the feel of what made the game good, the changes Kojima Productions did only made Metal Gear Solid better. They did'nt loose that Metal Gear Solid feel. You still use alot of the crawling and sneaking. Another thing I like is the HUD it has the bare minimum. No on screen map showing you where the enemy is. The only way to keep track of your enemy is to tag them with your binoculars. This makes the game feel real and full of suspense.

This is just a prologue! You only get one map with this game. When I found this out I was kind of dissapointed at first. After I completed the first mission which was awsome. It unlocked other missions within the same map. So you can replay this alot and not get bored. 

This game is worth it if your a hardcore Metal Gear Solid fan like me. It's a nice little taste of what is to come of The Phantom Pain.

13912403,76561197983304579,"The enemy AI in this game is absolutely why I continue to play, and replay this game at least once a week.

When I play stealth games, I'm not interested in learning patrol patterns and sneaking around them with no problem. What I'm really interested in is an AI system that has context and situational awareness. This game has both. The main mission takes place during a hurricane, naturally this gives the AI reduced sight/hearing and what have you. I'll give a very brief example of the AI's contextual awareness.

After getting spotted and going into the, as I understand it, new slow motion 'second chance' system where you can take out the enemy that spotted you and go unnoticed, I shot the unlucky guard in the face with a suppressed weapon. Minutes later I intercept a radio transmission from the control tower the the guard I just took out. From what I can tell each guard is assigned a number 'Delta 1, Delta 2' and so on. Since the guard they were radioing was out of commision, they sent another guard to check on him. Soon they found the body. 

In most stealth games you'd expect them to see the body and then either that guard doesn't tell anybody and searches for you, or other guards that have no idea what happened all know you're there. This game was different.
He assessed the situation and radioed back to the tower that he died of a gunshot wound and since nobody reported hearing one, concluded that the intruder responsible must be using a suppressed weapon. After hearing this information, the entire base went on alert with sirens going off all over the place and backup arriving just a minute later.

Most stealth games these days have me feeling pretty confident that I can hide around a corner and I won't get spotted. This is not the case for Ground Zeroes. If you want to get 20 feet inside this base without getting seen or heard, you need to find a vantage point and survey the area for a good 5 minutes, tagging enemies, trucks, watch towers ect.
This is as true to life as any stealth game I've played has come for me in the past 20 years. If you like MGS, this is worth checking out to get a taste of the Phantom Pain. If you like stealth games, there's enough here to keep you busy without knowing the setting or story.

This is just an example of how advanced this AI is for this type of open world setting. I'm a new fan of the MGS games and other than the Metal Gear Acid 'board games' for the PSP is my first time playing any MGS game.

13888627,76561198007472616,"It's a shame people only talk about the lenght of this game, and not about its undeniable quality.
Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes is a really well-done product.
Yes, the game is just a prologue, featuring the same very big map, but its more than worth the very very small price you can buy it for.
The gameplay is amazing!
The older metal gear solid games (which i still love) stiffness is gone, and now Big Boss finally is a fluid character.
This is the perfect evolution of the classic stealth gameplay of the saga, and there are so many welcome changes.
This is the first metal gear solid game in which you are actually free to approach the mission however you like to.
The ""Camp Omega"" (the map of the game) is a very big and articulated sandbox, that can be navigated in many different ways.
You can finally forget about those corridors of the older games.
The map offers a lot of covers and sneaking routes but, at the same time, is literally filled with enemies, and so some times you need all of your stealth skills to pass undetected.
Sure, you can still go ""All Guns Blazing"", or neutralise all enemies with the tranquilizer gun, but these are the worst ways to play the game.
Disable reflex, try to avoid enemies, complete all secondary objects and do not trigger any alarm.
This way you'll be rewarded with one of the best (and most challenging) stealth experiences available!
For the first time in the saga the enemies can finally spot you; even from a distance! So passing under their eyes this time will take so much more skill (and that's a good thing).
Some people believe the game only features the main mission (Ground Zeroes), but there's so much more to the package!
The 6 side/extra missions (which take place in the same map, but different times of the day) are really well made and they offer a complexity and dynamism i really didn't expect.
It was a true joy playing them.
So in the end you get a very well made prologue with 7 missions that can easily take you something like 8 hours to complete with an s-rank, and that assuming you don't want to chase achievements (For that you'll need so many more hours), all for a very very small price (You can find this game online (legit keys) for 10 dollars).
A brief note on the technical side; the port is amazing! It's greatly optimised and works flawlessly.
The graphics are perfect! A huge amount of detail and an amazing lighting system. the fox engine is a true beast.
This prologue really gives us a small teste of the masterpiece the phantom pain will be, and it's highly recommended to all MGS fans.

Pros:

- Modern Stealth Gameplay
- Fluid Character's Movements
- Satisfying Difficulty (If played as a stealth purist)
- Amazing ""Sandbox-Style"" map
- Many different approaches to the same goals
- Inspired side missions
- Many easter eggs
- Many Collectables/Hidden objectives
- Greatly Optimised Port
- AMAZING Graphics
- Amazing presentation (As usual with Kojima)

Cons:

- Only one (Even if very big and articulated) map
- Needs too much patience to complete achievements (Some of which ask you to complete the same missions over and over and over again)
- The game can be completed in a very short time, if played without chasing the ultimate stealth experience.
- Makes the wait for the phantom Pain even harder than it used to be",1420685945,1420686222,1,0.6292185187339783,1693,1675,1458317373,"{""recommendationid"": ""13888627"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198007472616"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 60, ""playtime_forever"": 1693, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1675, ""last_played"": 1458317373}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""It's a shame people only talk about the lenght of this game, and not about its undeniable quality.\nMetal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes is a really well-done product.\nYes, the game is just a prologue, featuring the same very big map, but its more than worth the very very small price you can buy it for.\nThe gameplay is amazing!\nThe older metal gear solid games (which i still love) stiffness is gone, and now Big Boss finally is a fluid character.\nThis is the perfect evolution of the classic stealth gameplay of the saga, and there are so many welcome changes.\nThis is the first metal gear solid game in which you are actually free to approach the mission however you like to.\nThe \""Camp Omega\"" (the map of the game) is a very big and articulated sandbox, that can be navigated in many different ways.\nYou can finally forget about those corridors of the older games.\nThe map offers a lot of covers and sneaking routes but, at the same time, is literally filled with enemies, and so some times you need all of your stealth skills to pass undetected.\nSure, you can still go \""All Guns Blazing\"", or neutralise all enemies with the tranquilizer gun, but these are the worst ways to play the game.\nDisable reflex, try to avoid enemies, complete all secondary objects and do not trigger any alarm.\nThis way you'll be rewarded with one of the best (and most challenging) stealth experiences available!\nFor the first time in the saga the enemies can finally spot you; even from a distance!

Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes, now with a quick google and forum search, you'll see the torrents of abuse towards this ""Half the price as a full retail game tech demo"" nonsense. On top of it all, ignore that.

This is Kojima's masterpiece of advertising, almost a teaser. 
From the moment you press start, this amazing cinematic of ground zeroes instantly pulls you in. The sound, the atmosphere, you feel as if you're part of some summer blockbuster.

Then once you begin, you're awestruck by what even a modest PC can show you. 
Using the binoculars I zoomed in on two marines having a chat about an event in the opening cinematic, the faces photorealistic, not a single balaclava or full faced helmet in the entire complex (Apart from prisoners I must add, but see any camp x-ray photo of prisoners if you think why would they do this?).

On one of the missions you are to retrieve intelligence, but knowing the events of the mission, I snuck around and nosed at what the soldiers of camp omega where upto. I was amazed to hear two soldiers chatting about knowing a certain secret of the mission and how its been altered in a subtle way. Now 99% of players wouldn't of heard this, but for it to be put it, on the off chance, astounded me.

Now to move onto the missions on ground zeroes, yes they're short, but you can tackle them a million plus ways!
I did playthroughs of most missions where I pretty much crawled through any possible track of cover to get this done, I then did this whilst doing my very best Rambo / Arnie impressions. 
Every single mission, every single play style, resulted in totally different results and reactions.

           It also runs great on 4k with a GTX 760, no lagging issue

Cons : The story mode lasts 40 minutes

Pretty sure that ""The Phantom Pain"" is going to be amazing
I already knew about it's lenght so i can't really complain, but i still expectect something a little bit longer.
On a personnal note, i was used to the classic MGS controls and i'm more invested in the story then the side mission.

13869081,76561198058911966,"The good:
Excellent port of what is, at its core, an excellent game. The classic MGS stealth reimagined in an open world, with some minor tweaks to mechanics. Let me begin by saying that I really like this game, and could go on at great length as to why I like it. Instead of doing this, I'm going to focus on the few small issues that I dislike about this game, as I hope this will be more informative. (Also, I played this quite a bit more on PS3, so please disregard my low hour count on PC). 

1. Keifer freakin' Sutherland. They didn't even try to get someone who SOUNDED like the Snake/Big Boss from the previous games. Really breaks the immersion for me. I'm really hoping this is explained through some plot twist in MGS5, such as it actually being Grey Fox or someone other than BB. 

2. The ""awareness detection"" mechanic is a little overpowered. It's pretty common for the game to indicate that some far-off enemy that I cannot see at all has spotted me, and I can simply hide until he looks away. The entire point of MGS is to truly engage with the stealth, and that means relying on your own senses rather than some magical sixth-sense that the Boss has. Makes me miss the days of the Soliton Radar, or the pretty excellent sense ring from MGS4.

3. Likewise, the ""slow time"" mechanic when you're spotted seems pretty OP. Being able to run into a group of four grunts and easily put tranq darts into each of their faces during slow-mo makes it a lot less punishing to be caught. I know you can disable this, but it feels wrong to have it included in the first place. 

4. I don't like the COD-style health regen. Give me the health system from Snake Eater any day, where wounds are permanent(ish) and actively affect your performance, and you also have to worry about hunger and mental state. 

All in all, it's still a really good game.

13851133,76561198066056468,"Well I am a hugh Metal Gear fan and seeing the MGS franchise finally hitting the consoles is amazing.
The first release was Rising Revengance witch delivered at steady 60 fps with and mid-range card... 
And now this
This game is one of the few ports that feels optimized also for the PC platform, there is not a lot of performance issues (the only one I noticed was when I entered another area and the game saved, I got some frame drops, but not too much to ruin the experience)
I will recommend this to all MGS fans to see how far the franchise has come, if you care about story and this is your first, I would not recommend it to you, but if you like a fun stealth sandbox, please go ahed and buy it :D

On the rating scale I would give this a 9.5 out of 10, but that is more a personal score. 

(Both positive and bad) 
Honestly the game is hard, without the fine ability called reflex mode you got less than a second to act before the alarm goes off, I wish I got a chance to do something about it without the reflex. But with reflex it could get hard aswell. 

 - The cutscenes feel sloppy (Unstedy cams, maybe meant to be, but not cool to look at)
 - Soldiers in Camp Omega has no voices, WHY? (MGS3 every soldier had a voice, makes this game feel cheep)
 - Could have gotten more stealth sidemissions in the night, most of the side missions are in daytime and not that fun
 - Kazuhira Miller and tutorials, just won't sh*t up (pardon my language)

 + The game main story is 1 - 2 hours long, but that only gets you 18% THIS means replayability wich is good.
 + SIDE MISSIONS!
 + Fun gameplay
 + Steady 60 FPS with a mid range GPU

Beware that i may edit this review to be better for everyone plus i will work to write the portuguese from brazil version of it. Any suggestion is greatly welcomed.

Now, let's start.

Altough i rated this game as recommended,  beware that not everyone will be happy about this game and with valid reasons which i'll explain in the end of this review.

First, i'll start about the graphics, animations and sound effects. They are nothing short of amazing, just like you could expect from any metal gear game. What impressed me more was the animations, which felt really realistic for a game. Plus you'll see great water effects on clothes, walls and even on floor, reflecting light pretty well and on floor it even reflects nearby enviroment, which is something i havent see it yet on any game (i may have noticed in some but this is really the first time i saw it). And the sound effects and voice acting are pretty good too. Don't listen to those bashing Kiefer Sutherland, who acted as snake. He did a pretty good job voicing. You may prefer David hayter as a original voice actor, of course. But you can't deny the good job by kiefer sutherland as well. So, you see, the technical part of this game is pretty solid. REally, this is may be the best port i have ever seen on pc. I can run it on ultra with 1620 p resolution with a steady 60 fps. And on 3820 x 2000 p with a steady 35. (Using a gtx 980). Nothing short of amazing, didnt have a single noticeable fps drop while playing this game. Only bad thing is the depth of field. There's no separated option to turn it off. If you disable it, in the screen processing settings, you'll disable AA and water reflection. I'm really waiting for a patch or mod that allows me to remove the annoying dof.

Second, the gameplay, i really enjoyed it and Kojima once again made a pretty immersive stealth game. If you are a newcomer, the game is mainly about you do your missions avoiding being seeing. You'll get better ratings and awards if you don't kill anyone and don't get caught. But you are still free to engage combat and in this game you have more ways than before to spread chaos, since you can even drive armored vehicle and use them to shoot enemies, but beware that you'll never make S ranking that way and you cant take much damage or you'll die. This is a great thing imo. It offers for both stealth and combat players and this game delivers nice quality for each of them without decaying in quality. Really liked how sometimes the AI act more varied than before, like sometimes changing patterns of patrolling. What i liked it most was when i was doing a mission where i had to deal with two targets. Each one were in different areas already pinpointed in your map. if you take some time to reach them, they may start moving to other areas of the map, thus making you having to either search them (in my case, one just showed up near me, while i was far from his area, which scared the hell out of me because almost trigered an alert.). Another good stuff is how you can threat your enemies when you hold them and they can give crucial informations about your objectives or point areas with weapons or useful stuff for you. It feeks awesome to get these.  Still, i miss how you could knock walls to atract enemies . I guess it may be removed to be more realistic, like you couldn possibly make knocks sounds and the enemy go to investigate and then claim it was his imagination.  But nevertheless, the controls may get some time to get used to but once they do, you'll start playing pretty smoothly (i used 360 controller, cant say about K + M). To end this, you have more than just one mission to this game, which gives replayability value, since you can beat them in different ways. Just like peace walker, but more open world and free. I really enjoyed this and i think this is something that every MGS fan will as well. But an annoying thing is that kaz doesnt't stop talking and repeating basics and stuff. I wish i there was a way to at least make him talk less

3, the story. Well, you cant expect much about the story. Is just one mission just after the events of peace walker. If you havent play it, don't worry, the game will provided the previous story for people to understand it. But the the small bit it was showed in the game about the story is pretty good and immersive. If you are a newcomer to the series, beware that this game is known to have pretty long cutscenes. So expect one in the beggining of the mission and other in the end. A thing worth noticing about the story is that kojima is trying to make this game kinda polemic. What i mean is: expect some pretty cruel torture torture here. Just like war, which is what kojima is trying to show how bad and cruel it is. And in a bit of the game, he succeed very well in doing it. Just warning it to some players who may not like very gruesome stuff. It is not a con imo. But i understand why some people may be unconfortable, specially when that's the objective of kojima.

Finally, i really liked this game, bought it while it was on sale and at least i felt it was worth. I really liked this game and i played more than my play time sugests ( iwas having problems with internet). Does that mean i can recommend this game to everyone? Unfortunately, no. here comes the thing that annoyed most people: the game indeed doesnt offer much content. You only get one map to do all your missions. A somewhat big map, sure. But just one. And the enemies will be in similar positions in every missions. If you played peace walker, you'll understand this. You'll have side missions in the same area of story missions. And this is the case, all you do will be in the same map. If you are not ok with this, i can completly understand and i can say that this game isn't for you, unless you get it on a sale or with price drop. Just notice that is not as bad as some people say like ""wow, a demo"". This game offers more than a demo but still doesnt offer enough for some people for it's price. So do THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU PLAN ON PURCHASING THIS GAME! But i can say that i already cant wait for the full game.",1420404715,1421675920,1,0.523809552192688,1177,591,1514590385,"{""recommendationid"": ""13836461"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198086508721"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 4, ""playtime_forever"": 1177, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 591, ""last_played"": 1514590385}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""English review / Análise em português.\n\nBeware that i may edit this review to be better for everyone plus i will work to write the portuguese from brazil version of it.

The game takes place after Peacewalker (from the PSP) and fills in the gap before and right up to Phantom Pain.  The game can either go really quick (if you run around and not care to get spotted and blow everything up.. but why the hell would you play a stealth game like that?) or it can be really long for the one main story mission.  The main mission is, sneak in, find and extract your first target, then find and extract your second target.  Your options to approach in all instances are entirely up to you.

There are many unlockables, difficulty modes and time challenges.  For a ""demo"", there is so much content. I would agree with others that it is more like packaged DLC.  The side missions do place you on the same island, but give you objectives to complete that offer more insight into the story of the base you are doing your missions in.  If anything, it's showing you how the open world aspects of Phantom Pain is going to work. 

Graphically this game is amazing.  Highest settings possible and this game still runs smooth like silk (at least on my system).

I wish I could Congratulate Kojima in person with a NES copy of Metal Gear and a Hammer, for him to break it with. I'd be glad to do it for him.

(Because I hear he hates that version.)

It's a beautiful game, movement/gameplay is certainly quite familiar to any MGS3, MGS4 and MGS Peace Walker players. Binocular vision could use a toggle option, and all in all I like playing it.

Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a Tech Demo compared to most games being sold on steam for the same price. Gameplay is splendid, but it lacks many basic features of full games. Such as Multiplayer, a single player campaign, and lots of other goodies. It's fun to replay, but it's good to remember that at the end of the day, this is a tech demo. I'm sure you could have the same amount of fun time on just about any other demo they give away for free.

Knowing this, despite the exemplary gameplay and fine aim,

I cannot honestly recommend this game to anyone. 

20 dollars should fetch you a glorious single player campaign and multiplayer, not a demo.

I wish I could Congratulate Kojima in person with a NES copy of Metal Gear and a Hammer, for him to break it with. I'd be glad to do it for him.\n\n(Because I hear he hates that version.)\n\nIt's a beautiful game, movement/gameplay is certainly quite familiar to any MGS3, MGS4 and MGS Peace Walker players. Binocular vision could use a toggle option, and all in all I like playing it.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a Tech Demo compared to most games being sold on steam for the same price. Gameplay is splendid, but it lacks many basic features of full games. Such as Multiplayer, a single player campaign, and lots of other goodies. It's fun to replay, but it's good to remember that at the end of the day, this is a tech demo. I'm sure you could have the same amount of fun time on just about any other demo they give away for free.\n\nKnowing this, despite the exemplary gameplay and fine aim,\n\nI cannot honestly recommend this game to anyone. \n\n20 dollars should fetch you a glorious single player campaign and multiplayer, not a demo.\n\n40-50 dollars should grant you a dream come true.

13820314,76561198058652518,"This game is pretty damn fantastic.
It looks pretty great, not just in terms of hard visuals, but also in movement. All of the animations are fluid and transition into one another great. 
The 'story' (if you will) Is short as clone snake's lifespan. It's ok, short, and tense. Lots of cliffhangers and pokes at the full game. Makes more sense if you've played Peacewalker (psp), but has a short visual novel sort of thing to bring you up to speed.
This game plays like a damn fiddle. Smooth gameplay and stealth mechanics, great voicework and attention to overal detail and TONS of replayability make this game a semi-worthy buy.

BUT WAIT THERE BE CONS!:
short- can be overlooked because of extra content, secrets and general replayability, but still frustrating.
CONTROLS- It seems that controls were overlooked pretty hard during the conception of the pc port. Many keys are... odly placed(example: to turn your flashlight on/off you have to push 'L' while aiming [LMB])... and some menu aspects could've been modified to better suit the PC environment. The menus, pulled up by pressing TAB (acceptable) can only be navigated with keyboard control, and even clunkier, require the use of the 1 & 3 keys to opperate. 
Overall, these things can be rebinded and once again, can be overlooked to a certain degree.
-Weapons swapping etc.:
Potentially my biggest gripe about the game, the menu system that is used to swap weapons is unforgivably complicated and uselessly hard to use wtih Kb&M controls. When rebinding there is a key you can hold to access a weapon 'wheel' sort of thing, but it requires use of the arrow keys. I do not understand why this has to be so complicated.
Alot of tips during loading screens also are only listed for controller keys, so half the time they arent very helpful.

New comers to the series may be disappointed with the story considering it takes place directly after the events of Peace Walker. You'll be left almost entirely in the dark even if you listen to every single cassette tape.

Fans of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker will feel right at home here as the game is a huge improvement in both graphics and gameplay.

No more punches pulled and no more tickle rods for torture, this is the real deal.

Sutherland's voice is good, but under used in comparison to the amount of voice acting Big Boss had in Peace Walker.  Even in the tapes he rarely speaks and it's a little unsettling given how much of a talkative character he's been throughout the whole series.

Things that annoyed me about this game...

The mouse does not work on the menu. There is a mouse cursor that you can move around, but you can not use it to click on any menu options. Arrow keys and Enter only.

It feels like the game is still setup primarily for console control with keyboard controls being second. There is even still an option to enable or disable vibration feedback. Why do i need this on a PC? And before you say maybe someone wants to hookup a controller to their PC to play id say, um no, they would already be playing on a console instead of the PC.

Custom keyboard mapping is severely limited. Basically you can only use the letters. It would not let me use any keys on the Num keypad, the home, end, insert, delete, backspace, enter, { } [ ] ' ; "" : , . / < > ? - _ = + \ | *
It did let me map the mouse middle button to `weapons reload`, but then during game play that button change camera location from left to right shoulder so i couldn't reload and had to pick another key. And the action of changing camera location isn't even in the custom key mapping screen to change away from that mouse button. I could not map my keys in a way that was comfortable and allowed my fingers to easily reach keys without having to look down and reach across the key board. Why would you not allow all keys be used in custom mapping?

There is an action to `Dive` which puts you on your stomach. However it only works if you are running and then hit the dive key. WTF? Stealth game right? You can not lay down on your stomach to crawl around without running first? Hey bad guys, im about to sneak up on you so look at me running and drawing attention to myself.

The mouse movement to turn the direction you are facing is very squirrely. When trying to use an action like climb a ladder or pickup a weapon you have to be facing the item in a sweet spot to be able to hit the action key even if you are standing directly over it. So when you are moving fast trying not to get caught, dancing in circles while standing over an item trying to get your squirrely mouse in the sweet spot, can get frustrating fast.

By this point i had enough frustration and just gave up trying to play it. Not being able to map my keys how i like them and get into a comfortable grove just ruined the game for me. I spent more time messing with awkward key layout then being able to get into the game play.

But hey, the graphics were pretty. Nothing better then COD:AW or Farcry4, but i guess to some the graphics is more important then game play.",1420298061,1420298061,0,0.46633416414260864,51,51,1420292904,"{""recommendationid"": ""13809175"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198031031254"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 16, ""playtime_forever"": 51, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 51, ""last_played"": 1420292904}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""I am not happy with the PC port of this game.

13797624,76561198004355573,"It's short, no denying that. As I'm sure you've heard, the game is incredibly short. I knew this going in, and intentionally took my time. I was still able to finish it in an hour and ten minutes. 

Granted, the ""story"" is supplemented by several side missions (only playable after you finish the story) which range from meeting contacts to rescuing agents, finding intel, destroying facilities, or even assassinating different people (whom you must identify from pictures). All in all, it's several hours of gameplay.

As for the gameplay itself? Honestly, it's pretty fantastic. Combat is tight, stealth is difficult and rewarding, from what I've seen, the AI is very smart and pretty perceptive, none of that ""hide three feet from their face"" you get from ""stealth"" in games like Skyrim. If you aren't hidden, they'll spot you from a hundred yards, and they'll investigate. Very good AI.

The game boasts an ""open world"", but the open world is a single prison camp on Cuba. The camp is not especially large, and some of the features new to  the Metal Gear franchise are pretty useless as a result, like Snake's new ability to drive vehicles (that said, I did enjoy the AI's use of vehicles in patrols and transportation).

The screenshots look pretty fantastic, right? You'd think that there's no way you could get your rig to do something like that. I'll admit, my computer is pretty decent in regards to gaming, but it often lags behind on newer titles. This game, however? It runs amazingly. Seriously, this might be the best optimized game engine I have ever played. I was getting those graphics at high FPS. Only in a handful of occasions did the game ever stutter, and these events were brief and far between.

For the story quality, there honestly isn't that much. The game is literally, with no exaggeration here, ""Go here, get this guy, bring him to the chopper. Go there, get that girl, bring her to the chopper. Cutsene. Credits."" At best, it's a demo/prologue of Phantom Pain. At worst, it's an epilogue to Peace Walker. The game takes place right after the end of Peace Walker, and centers around the rescues from a Cuban base of two characters from Peace Walker. The game does include some backstory which you can view, which is nice, but people who played PW (such as myself) will probably appreciate the characters more, and feel the impact of certain events near the end much more.

Now, the final verdict: The game is fantastic, and that only makes it that much more painful that there's so little to enjoy. I'm going to give it a different rating based on the price. If it's on sale for five bucks, I'd say it's a must-buy. If it's on sale for ten, I'd give it some thought. For twenty? A flat-out no, unless you're an absolute die-hard fan. I'm giving it a thumbs up for in general, as it is a good game, but if you aren't able to get it on sale, I'd suggest you just go ahead and skip this one; buy the Phantom Pain when the game is worth the price. Watch a playthrough on Youtube. It'll only take an hour.

It has the main storyline which by standards is shirt, but a ton of replay value after your first play through. The PC version is by far the most spectacular, it shows off the Fox Engine at its finest if you have the hardware to back it up (move over 1080, here comes 4k), sorry console purist the master race wins this time.

If you've played any of the Metal Gear Solid series, then you already know what type of cinematic journey you're in for and it is well worth it albeit shorter than usual.

The new voice casting is not a big deal as I had originally thought it would be. Lets leave it at that, we know the details already. It may be just me, but I couldn't help but find EVERY male character that is in Snake's circle of friends sounded alike, just an odd quirk and slightly annoying, not enough to detract from the game.

I've been a fan (not die-hard) of the Metal Gear Solid games since Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation which also made its way to pc way back when.  Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty blew me away and probably my favorite entry thus far was Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.(though I finished that game with great difficulty due to the hideous camera system, the setting's been one of my favorites)  I never quite finished MGS4 but I enjoyed my time with it.   MGSV however is priming itself to be my favorite in the series if it keeps going this way.

I'll start off by saying I first bought and played Ground Zeroes on the Playstation 4.  My sentiments are the same for that version.  I went ahead and bought the pc version as a litmus test to see if it ran like everyone says it does.  True what has been said, this is an amazing port of a console game.  I have the game maxed at every setting save for SSAO which I left on high with 1920x1080 resolution with vertical sync enabled and she runs like a dream.  I probably have at least seven to eight hours in the PS4 version.  I just bought the pc version today and have clocked an hour and 34 screenshots.

There is a lot of content here alongside the main mission.  Kojima filled this prologue chock full of side missions and other elements.  Just soaking up the lore through listening to recordings on your casette player is great.  The gameplay is classic, pure third person stealth.  The control scheme is very comfortable and easy to get used to.  I personally think because it was designed well, that a controller is the most ergonomic way to play this.  That coupled with buttery fluid animations and an open map that you can approach at any angle make for superb gameplay.  

I won't make the assumption that if you are a MGS fan that you'll like this but because I am I think you will.  Its still that beautiful production value and presentation that we know and are accustomed to.  Down to the little sound effects and camera work this game oozes detail and atmoshpere.  I also believe that if you are an old school Splinter Cell fan (Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory) that you too would love this game even if you've never played a MGS game before.  In fact this would probably be the place for you to start as anything prior to MGS4 would probably frustrate you.  Believe me there are things about the series that have frustrated me over the years.  Mainly because of the control schemes and the fact that the game is known for Boss fights and I'm the type of gamer that loathes Boss fights.  But for the Metal Gear Solid franchise I put up with them because I enjoy the series very much.  I love the deep, confusing themes, conspiracies, mysteries, presentation, production value and almost operatic drama of these games.

I've been gaming for twenty-five years and this is a wonderful game.  I can not wait for the Pantom Pain to be released.

There’s been just one game that I finished in a single sitting, and that’s Metal Gear Solid IV: Guns of the Patriots on PS3. This fact is more a testament to the design of MGS IV than my unwavering commitment to the franchise. Let’s be clear: I’m not a Metal Gear Solid or Hideo Kojima fan boy. The reason it kept me hooked was the ebb and flow of the missions as well as even distribution of gameplay sections and long cut scenes (some long enough for you to consume entire meals while watching them like a TV show). But primarily it was the accessibility. MGS IV was a walk in the park compared to Ground Zeroes.

You’re probably aware of the biggest complaint people seem to have with Ground Zeroes. The game can be ‘beaten’ in around 20 minutes. If you’re looking to simply finish Ground Zeroes, it can be done with minimal to no effort at all, but bear in mind that you shouldn’t be playing it in the first place if that was your intention.

Ground Zeroes is a showcase. It is Kojima Productions experiment to craft an open-world with a difference—not one merely filled with side quests and characters to interact with, but one of an enormous scale in which you are free to explore everything without having to suspend disbelief. And by God, have they succeeded. It’s just a shame they’re asking you to pay $19.99/`1,200 for the recently released PC version. And while this is the definitive version of the game thanks to native 4K support and inclusion of bonus content from both Xbox and PlayStation versions, one can’t help but wonder if Kojima-san wanted to give away this game for free, and was promptly overruled by the evil corporate overlords at Konami who sniffed a revenue opportunity.

[b]FOR THE COMPLETIONIST[/b]

After a trademark intro cut scene, you find yourself in the shoes of Big Boss with the task of extracting certain prisoners of war from an island prison. Do this successfully and you’ll open up extra missions and situations, as well as bonus objectives. For the completionist, Ground Zeroes is a wet dream, with different ways not just to beat missions but traverse the excellently designed sandbox of Camp Omega and discover something new every time you do it.

There’s a tonne of stuff here for fans (who have probably bought this anyway), but for those on the fence, there are several reasons to pick up Ground Zeroes. First, it’s the most complete stealth action game available today. None of the mechanics are watered down, it is intuitive but not accessible, and it’s mostly unforgiving to careless play. Guards may follow certain patrol routes, but they will surprise you with their intelligence and unpredictability on occasion. Get caught, and you’ll have once chance to headshot your potential captor—miss your chance and you’ll be in a spot of bother to say the least. MGS has been guilty of limiting gameplay scope, preferring to go down the cool-but-linear party tricks route, ‘meta’ gameplay and easter eggs. Ground Zeroes is the exact opposite, with a strong gameplay basis and true open-world mechanics.

However, you’re likely to get the most out of this only if you’re a hard-core MGS fan or find Splinter Cell too easy. For the rest, there are games out there with ten times the content Ground Zeroes offers, and with more variety (Far Cry 4, for instance). Without a doubt, I enjoyed Ground Zeroes, as I’m sure anybody who plays it will. But the game also makes you wonder at the type of company that charges ₹1306 for a demo.

13778695,76561197960412994,"MGS V: GZ is great action-stealth game with a lot of replayability despite the short length of the main story mission.

The gameplay is a mix of stealth and action in a single, wide-open area. All of the missions take place in that same, single area. You can approach the main mission as well as the 7 side/extra missions with either a stealth or guns-blazing mentality. The ranking that you receive at the end of completing the missions favors complete stealth with no killing, so you'll find the game the most rewarding if sneaking games are your thing. Certain missions really deter a purely action-forward style by introducing infinite guards when you are discovered. I found that a mix of 80% stealth/20% action was the most exciting: sneak on the way into the base and then let some bullets fly on your escape for a cinematic finish. Rocket launch a wooden guard tower on the flight out, sending the guard inside 30 ft. into the air for extra Rambo points.

FAQ:

Is the game really only 90 minutes?
Yes and no. The main story mission will probably take you around 90 minutes on Normal difficulty on your first time through. However, if you like stealth games like Hitman and enjoy completing the challenges/achievements in them, you'll find a great value in Ground Zeroes. I spent around 30 hours getting a 100% completion rate, which mean that I got S-rank on all 8 missions, both Normal and Hard, and collected all the cassette tapes and XOF patches hidden around the base. I'd say the only lame achievements were the XOF patch and cassette collecting. You pretty much need to have your nightvision goggles on 24/7 and eagle eyes in order to spot them all. You can interrogate guards to find locations of them too but it's just a dumb, archaic gaming trope to have to ""collect"" items. It was okay in 1996 with Mario 64 but it's been nearly 20 years since then.

Is it a good MGS game?
Yes. It's the most fun I've had with MGS since MGS3. MGS4 was a complete dumpster fire of a game. It's refreshing to see this initial chapter of MGS5 prove that Kojima still knows how to create a real game instead of the awful anime-movie-game that was MGS4. To be fair, the one noticeable thing that Ground Zeroes is missing is a proper boss battle, but that's kind of a good sign in a way too: that Kojima doesn't feel completely chained to the experience of the previous games in the series and really wants to make MGS5 the best game possible.

In my opinion there isn't even near enugh content for the cash, even if the area aproximately as big as one of the smaler cities in assasins creed there is nothing to search for or to discover.
Well some additional tests and objects as well as some audio tapes, but that are just gimmicks.

About the difficulty, you can just run arround in plain sight at the normal difficulty. The enemys act pretty stupid, they react to not silenced gunshots, but they don't hit nor work together.

Those who want to use this game as an introductory course to the series are going to be confused and maybe even put off. Even fans who are expecting a long Metal Gear-esque story may be disappointed by the brevity of the title's main mission, lack of boss fights, and lack of certain special items.
      
       However, Ground Zeroes is a great little treat for fans and those already excited for The Phantom Pain -- and what a treat it is!

The side missions the title comes with definitely pad out the run time, but are all fun and can be approached from any angle you can think of. If you are already a fan of the series, two of the side missions will make you giddy with nostalgia (Deja Vu) and awed with sheer... well, awesomeness! (Jamais Vu)

3- no new side-ops every thing the same than the console ... so why ?
4- this game doesn't support dualshock 4 or 3 !
5- keyboard and mouse are horrible in this game ! and glitchy ! specific in mouse !
the game looks really nice put kojima he want to make theis game look like the console ! so there are no difference between console and PC so far !

No? Ok fine I'll elaborate a bit. Especially since a lot of PC gamers may not know much about the metal gear solid series anyhow. 

So while this game was bashed a lot on release for being really short I really enjoyed it, and I think it was fully worth my money. While the game is very short the quality is amazing.  The game runs well even on my crap cp, and I could run everything on high with a stable frame rate.  Also the open world way of going about the mission was done very well, and suits the mgs gameplay quite nicely actually.  One thing that really impressed me was how I could rescue each P.O.W., and how each one has seperate dialougues that hint towards their life and make you happy to save them.  Overall even though I beat the game In a hour there is a ton  of replayability,  and In my opinion it is completley worth the $20 purcchase.

The PC edition of METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES is definitely the definitive version. The game looks beautiful on even the lowest settings, and it isn't too hard to run it on max. Mods are available to enhance the graphics and unlock the framerate.
GAMEPLAY
GROUND ZEROES is definitely the best action stealth game on the market. The controls are great and the gunplay proves the game as a worthy third-person shooter, if that's how you choose to play. Although the main mission (yes, mission, without an S. There's only one story mission in GROUND ZEROES.) is fairly short, (it took me 99 minutes to complete on my first playthrough) there are 6 side missions that are included in GROUND ZEROES. Each of these missions vary in terms of gameplay, weather, and objective.
MODDING
As mentioned above, there are mods available to unlock the framerate and disable the DoF. Modders are currently working on model editors, but you can currently modelswap very easily. For more information on that, check the community hub guides.

To wrap it all up, I'd have to say that METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES is one of the best games to come out this year. You're missing out if you don't purchase it. For 20 dollars, it's a steal.

13735411,76561198085610038,"[h1] Hideo Kojima's newest installment to the Metal Gear Solid franchise, ""METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES"" proves big things certainly can come in small packages. [/h1]

[b] Note before I begin: No spoilers regarding the plot will be revealed in this review. [/b]

The length of the main story for me personally (keeping in mind I didn't explore or go for max-completion) took a measly two hours to complete (which has sparked a lot of controversy). Despite this however, the story in Ground Zeroes is a very strong one, especially considering that the game was designed to inform fans of  the events that occurred before Phantom Pain. 

A story in a Video Game or Movie however, is only as great as it is visually portrayed, Thankfully, the game looks beautiful. Kojima's previous installment to the series ""Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots"" was a big step in visuals for its time. In fact, most Metal Games exceed expectations in terms of visuals.  Ground Zeroes is no exception. It has surpassed the visuals of Guns of Patriots by a long shot. The environment, the structures and the other soldiers look incredible.  If you haven't already,  simply watch the first cinematic on Youtube. It doesn't give away too much, but rather gives a small introduction as to what you will be required to do for the mission.  What you see in the first cinematic is a strong representation as to what you can expect from this game in terms of visuals. You will not be let down.

Sound quality is also something that you will be amazed by. Most objects/actions you hear is very accurate in comparision to its real world counterpart. 

Due to the small length of the game, many will argue it is difficult for the player to grow attached to any of the characters at this point in time which I do agree with to some extent. That is something you will have to judge yourself IF you do decide to purchase this game.

Another thing to note is that I strongly believe this game appeals towards fans who have played previous installments as opposed to those who begin on this game. It does touch on events and reference Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker which may confuse some players. The game does give a very brief summary of the events that occurred in these titles but one may argue it's not enough.  If you have never played a Metal Gear Solid game do not start on this game. A HD collection was recently released containing both Snake Eater AND Peace Walker along with another popular title. Do yourself a favor and purchase it.

Whilst the stealth aspects of this game are great and work incredibly well, veterans will be disappointed to find the lack of new creative methods of concealing yourself. Bushes and shrubs similar to those from Snake Eater were my best friend throughout the story along with the tranq gun. However, I (personally) couldn't find nothing more than that. I may of missed it, but it certainly was not a prominent feature (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). 

The game does include ""spec-ops"" missions that attempt to extend the overall game time. I personally have not played them at this point in time but do intend on doing so. 

To summaries, if your interested a beautifully presented stealth (which means not ""runnin' and gunnin"") title WHICH is not too long, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes will certainly not disappoint.

Let us get this out of the way.  Yes, this game is small.  It has a mere seven missions which can all be completed within 10 minutes with the right technique, and is essentially a beta test for the fundamental gameplay of MGS 5.

The gameplay of Ground Zeroes is quite possibly the most enchanting and immersive I have ever witnessed.  The game is by no means realistic, as Snake can take quite a few bullets to the chest and then dig his head in the gravel to rejenerate his health, but it gives the player incredible control of the gameplay.  An example of this is the brilliantly designed extraction system.  In most(all) other ""action"" games, your point of extraction is pre-determined, as well as mostly every other really ""awesome"" moment.  In Ground Zeroes, I desparately threw three prisoners into the back of a truck as jets approached the prison base and drove them to the helicopter I had called in 30 seconds before.  I then unloaded the prisoners onto the helicopter, only to be assaulted by an armored car, which I promptly blew up by expelling a few rockets into it.  And finally I hopped onto the helicopter and shot at a lot of dudes who oddly enough never wear helmets before the mission was finally over.  The best part of these moments is the player is in complete control of the action.  In previous Metal Gear games, this would more than likely have been a cutscene, or at least a scripted event, yet I organically produced an awesome moment thanks to the incredibly open sandbox the FOX engine creates. 

A quick note on the graphics.  I have always been an advocate of gameplay > graphics, but the astonishing graphics of this game are both pleasing to the eye as well as a function of the gameplay.  It would be awfully hard to interpret the light levels of different areas if the game looked any less brilliant.  So, in short, the game looks gorgeous for good reason.

As far as story is concerned, yes you should read the wiki or at least play Peace Walker if you want to understand it.  Fortunately, this Snake's story is significantly less convoluted than that of Solid Snake, so no time paradoxes here.  The removal of the hand-drawn cutscenes and the new voice of Snake(the excellent Kiefer Sutherland) do make me a bit sad, but they do not remove from the gameplay and I can understand why these decisions were made.  In short, any changes to the story and, more importantly, the presentation of that story are forgiveable.

In conclusion, this is an incredible game with some of the most interesting gameplay I have seen in a long history of games.  For once we can be the awesome action hero of our childish dreams, and we also get to be Kiefer Sutherland.

After spending nigh on 15 hours with the PS3 version, there was no doubt left in my mind that Ground Zeroes was worthy of being a Metal Gear Solid game. Say what you will about the length of the main mission, but this game clearly makes a case for the term ""content"" being much more nuanced than how most people refer to it.

Camp Omega is the real star of the show in Ground Zeroes - feeling like an amalgamation of the very best levels from Thief, Hitman, and the Splinter Cell series in their heyday - and it reinforces how the stealth genre is more about the levels than anything else. Everything about Camp Omega feels like it was crafted by experts: The believable vantage points, the sparing-yet-dense use of both high and low grounds, the use of light and shadow, it's all there.

The PC version (both surprisingly and unsurprisingly) is the definitive way to play this game. The FOX Engine truly shines when left to flex its muscles on superior hardware. Seeing rainwater drip down the face of one of the many nameless soldiers I would chokehold into submission later on in the opening cutscene was the first sign of the capabilities of this new engine.

Why ? Well, personally, i wasn't too much against the idea of payed prequel if it were something like good old ""VR Missions"" packs of tens or hundreds (which were free addons for updated editions of the games) on the new engine or the prequel mission would have decent length and a boss fight (like Tanker from MGS2). Sadly, there is none of that. Camp Omega area is super small, even ""the admin building"" is not a building but a box, and you don't ""go inside"" but around the walls.

There are serious gameplay issues:
• Turning auto-compensation / bad movement transitions: BB does additional movements that are not requested by user (This is especially embarrassing since MGS1 is known for its fluid controls and sharp turning). In a stealth game [especially of The Stealth Franchise] it makes a difference between successful manoeuvre or mission failure
• Wall sticking is replaced by clunky cover mechanic. Now BB tends to clumsily stick out of cover, wall throws/shots are almost impossible because line of sight is obscured while BB manages to stick out and be seen by enemies
• Bullet replenishment on save's reload. And that in the series that is known for putting player in interesting tactical situations, like having 3 bullets and empty mag for 7 enemies. Blasphemy !
• Aggressive health regeneration
• Enemies lie down indefinitely on the ground with their rifles beside them (that's just silly)
• Enemy telepathy & ""reflex mode"" instead of great MGS2 alert system
• Magazines are infinite
• You can't ""cook"" grenades or throw them slow and under or, better yet, control the arc (see Syphon Filter 1-3 for great example)
• Kaz never shuts the fuck up on replay
• Konami hasn't bothered to put sword gameplay in Raiden's mission or update models for MGS1-styled mission

Some upsetting technical deficiencies:
• Camera is too shaky
• Geometry clipping
• Knocked out enemies and POWs sometimes disappear and suddenly reappear
• Mouse sensitivity for aiming is not adjustable and too big
• Additional mouse buttons are not recognized
• DOF is insanely overblown
• Critical settings like AA, DOF and exact level of filtering are not clearly exposed
• LOD changes are too visible
• PC version doesn't have ""music import"" even thought Steam has it's own music library now

Moreover, it has story inconsistencies too:
• Disastrous lack of cutscenes and dialogues
• How Snake can be ""formerly known as Big Boss"" if in the ending of PW (that GZ starts almost immediately after) he ordered to be called like that ?
• Paz's name is incorrect, it should be ""Pacifica Ocean""[spoiler]
• There can't be ""no time for anaesthetic"", the only thing they needed is a quick morphine injection, but then cutscene wouldn't be so dramatic
• A vagina-bomb ? Seriously ?! (see South Park ""The Snuke"" episode and ""24"" series)
• Runaway prisoner has a bag on his head.

I planned to buy this game on Xbox One when it was originally released but after hearing the initial reviews stating that the game could be beaten in under 30 minutes, i decided it was not worth the $40 price tag.

Enter MGS V: Ground Zeroes for PC.  Perfect timing in a plethora of ways.  Built my new rig a week before it was released which took me from barely meeting the low minimum specs to surpassing the recommended specs.  With the recent port releases spanning from RYSE, Dead Rising 3, Assassins Creed Unity and Far Cry 4, i had a bad taste in my mouth of ports.  While Far Cry 4 is playable, it suffered from some bad stuttering on release.  Unity was a bad prank that ubisoft should have waited until April to unleash.  I digress...To be blunt, MGS V is as perfect as you can get with a port.  Thanks Kojima!

MGS V was $13 when i purchased and at the moment i feel it has been worth every penny spent(DISCLAIMER: i am a MGS fan and have played all of them).  The gameplay is as fluid as ever and graphics look incredible at 1080p running somewhere around 60fps with a FX-8320+GTX750Ti SC+12gb Ram.  Not to mention the fact that i had OBS running in the background recording the entire thing, meaning i would probably gain 5-10fps.

While the actual story is quite short, this game is meant to be a short demo/prequel to the actual Metal Gear Sequel entitled the Phantom Pain.  Even after completing the Main campaign the game shows me somewhere around 10% completion which means there is a plethora of other things left to do outside the campaign.

But I was against this game at the time of the console release, because i didnt wanted to support a one and a half hours ""long"" game. Well,I was wrong.

Maybe the main story mission is short (around 90 minutes at first try), but there are 6 more missions takes another 50-90 minutes to complete each. At this time I have 14+ hours in this game and haven't completed all of the content, so i will go back again and continue this great game.

The open world setting and the very polished gameplay mechanics makes the thing so great. You can go from any direction, with any weapon, using any tactics from killing all, to sleep/stun the guys or just avoid them.

The various missions taking place different times of a day, and the camp's layout offers many possibilities to take on or fool those guards, who are present in different numbers and walking on different patrol routes in each mission.

An the top of that there is a real big replay value in this game. I am really not the guy, who likes to repeat the same thing all over again, but the rating system at the mission's end, and the unlockable weapons, skins, or easter eggs made me having great fun with this game.

Playing this game is the most fun from actual gameplay aspect than any other previous MGS title.

9/10 where the 9 means that this game is one of the best games in the genre if not.

+ Exemplary optimalization and port quality. Best of 2014
+ Very nice graphics and performance
+ Hell lots of ways to complete any mission

Only Bad things i encountered is the AI- #slightly retarded,
Was spotted in a back of a vehicle, layed in it and they just left after a few seconds back to patrolling, even in MGS 1 for PS1 they will flush you out with grenades.

Body parts no clipping through objects, knocking out guards ,character body movements goes into objects looks funny/bad, its 2014 fix that shit.

You'll see complaints about the length of this game. To clarify, the main mission in this game averages around an hour and forty minutes long. There are also numerous side missions to complete, which bump the playtime up to an average of six hours long. 

To complete the game 100%, that is collecting all cassette tapes, getting all accolades in-game, rescuing everybody you're supposed to, and getting the best rank you can in the game, unlocking absolutely everything there is to unlock, you're looking at an average of at least 16 and a half hours of game-play out of this game.

To reiterate, if you play it just for the main mission and put it down after that, you're going to be disappointed. The intent with the release of this product was for fans of the series to try out the new game, get performance statistics over a wide series of systems, and see how the community responded to major changes in how the game operated. 

Choose your own destiny. Are you going to play this as a four minute speed-run of just one mission, or are you going to actually completely play the game and enjoy every last bit of what you paid for?


Performance is excellent. You can tell that the Fox engine has been given tons of love with a multiplatform focus being the centric point behind it. Running a GeForce 660, I'm able to achieve 60FPS constantly in all situations with all settings maxxed (with the exception of SSAO being on high as opposed to very high.) 

The controls are excellent, keyboard and mouse users will not be disappointed - you can rebind any key to where you want. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous for me to even have to say that, but you'd be surprised with the massive number of shoddy console ports that have left this most basic function out. There are also a number of default controller layouts available for users whom are using standardized gamepads. 

Likewise, one of the most common complaints people have about the controls is the usage of arrow keys while in the menus - however they are not necessary. Somehow, everybody has overlooked the big prompts that say ""1"" and ""3"" in the menus, which should typically be enough to tell people that instead of relying on arrow keys to move the menus left and right, you can just use the ""1"" and ""3"" keys to scroll left and right respectively.

Story - 10/10. Yes, it's short, but this is intended as a prologue for the main game. The cassette tapes which can be found in all the missions provide more tastes of the story, making you desire for more.

2. Impressive Gameplay and mechanic (The movement look , feel and sound right)

3. Decent A.I (Found most times when setting off the alarm, soldiers will either charge towards my location or fall back and regroup forming a group of 4 or 3 soldiers to back each other up)

4. Vehicles (riding the helicopter and driving any vehicle is awesome, especially the ability to knock soldiers out and take them for a ride) 

5. Short....like a demo (The game is more of a tech demo, it does give a bit of a story leading towards Phantom Pain but there is just not enough there to keep you busy. The few missions there are do offer a bit of fun and enjoyment but being played on the same map as the story it gets boring fast) 

6. Price (Buying it during the sale was great but I sometimes wish the game was priced $10 or should be included as a pre-order towards Phantom Pain, for it to be a standalone is just not strong and I find myself pacing back and forth wanting Phantom Pain to be released) 

Overall Ground Zeroes offer a good taste of what is to come for the Metal Gear series, showing a bit of the gameplay and features that will appear in phantom pain. However for new players just entering the series it may feel strange charging $20 for a tech demo as well as create a bit of confusing as who is who and what is going on as the story branches off Peace walker. 

If your a diehard fan of Metal Gear I would recommend getting this and go around looking for all the cool little items and points of interests. If your just starting the series I would recommend picking up Peace walker for PSP or PS3/Xbox 360 to help establish a bit of the story or wait for the price to come down a bit to $10.

If you speedrun the game, you can complete every mission in about 2-3 hours. HOWEVER, if you are a completionist or enjoy the replay value that the map and missions have to offer, you can easily get about a dollar-per-hour of value out of the game. I didn't even S-rank everything and I got 17 hours out of the game for only ~42% completion. Be creative and don't expect to be spoon-fed your fun.

Now, for the gameplay. This is an exciting taste of what's to come for The Phantom Pain. There's a lot of loving detail included in the little things. The movement animations for Snake are amazing - 99% of his animations are believable save for a few cases where you can intentionally make him look stupid. The AI is decent, but predictable - however, it's hard to make AI that doesn't at some point become predictable. Having played on both a PS3 controller and a mouse + keyboard, I prefer the controller but the PC controls are ALMOST as comfortable save for a few hitches (which can be helped with some key rebindings.) Above all, the stealth action is challenging but satisfying, rewarding careful planning, quick execution, and ability to improvise.

The graphics are amazing and the game is optimized well. The story is admittedly edgy and kind of grimdark for a MGS game, but the series' brand of quirky humor still shines through in some missions.

[b]+Graphics[/b]
A japanese game with a perfect performance and it's one of the best examples of how is a good port, what is happening? 
Ah yes, NVIDIA support <3.
I tested the game in two different pc's (1st: GTX970, i5 2500K 4.5Ghz, 8GB / 2nd: GTX560Ti,  i5 3570 3.4Ghz, 8GB) and both runs the game smothly at 60fps and with everything in High and Extra High. It's incredible how good is this port. Very nice job from Kojima Productions and the graphics are incredible, the lightning effects are absolutely awesome.
[b]+Story[/b]
The main mission is very short... It's like if you cut just the cargo part of MGS2 and put it on a ""different ¿game?"", let's be honest it's just a demo of The Phantom Pain but in my opinion and as very fan of the series that cliffhanger at the end deserve that 13 euros I paid for this on the sales.
[b]+Extra missions[/b]
You also have some extra missions and two top secret missions and that ones are very funny, I dont want spoil but if you are a fan of the saga you will enjoy a lot that top secret stuff.
[b]+Gameplay[/b]
It's MGS4 but even better. I love the animations of this game for whatever you do is super smooth and the transitions between them are very good done.
The CQC is very fun and even more if you have several enemies around you. Dat slow motion for the CQC... <3
[b]+Map[/b]
The first time you play and they let you at that military base gives you the feeling of something very huge. It's true that after some hours playing you'll realize that the map it is actually quite small but the first impression playing the GZ mission is very spectacular.


[b]-Duration[/b]
It's a demo, benchmark or whatever you want call it of The Phantom Pain. That's all. Buy it with this in mind or wait hoping for a pack of Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.
[b]-No sound options[/b]
I dont know the reason about this... It's just very weird you cant configure nothing of the sound in the game, voices, sfx, music... Nothing, so you will open the windows volume mixer for this D:

13621036,76561198053605311,"I love stealth games, and my favorite has always been the MGS series. Got this mainly since this is the first MGS game ported to PC in years, and also I couldn't wait to see how The Phantom Pain would look and feel like. Here are my thoughts:

Cool stuff:
+ Excellent stealth mechanics and gameplay. Some carried over from MGS 4.
+ Smart AI. Much improved, and keeps you on your toes at all times.
+ Organic character animations and CQC.
+ Vehicles are driveable!
+ Movie quality soundtrack.
+ No game breaking bugs (and no glaring bugs within the game) encountered.
+ Incredible visual fidelity. Fox engine really shines! Special mention: the rain soaked battlefield is spectacular to look at. (Big Boss' mullet does not get wet in the rain though...lol)

Uncool stuff:
- Short campaign...feels like a demo. There are good reasons to replay to understand how non-linear the game is. There are 5 side missions and collectibles that are hard to find, to increase play time.
- Signature gameplay elements like camouflage system (returns in the Phantom Pain) and food consumption/meal management to regain health/stamina are not in here.

Nitpicks:
* Not a fan of reflex mode as it turns your playthrough super-simple. Thankfully, it can be turned off.
* No boss fights. MGS is well-known for its awesome boss fights.
* Seems like Kojima-san was inspired by mechanics in games like Far Cry 3, Splinter cell etc. He borrows few ideas. Doesn't spoil experience, but makes it more like other action games.
* No David Hayter as Snake! New VA performance is not as memorable.
* This is a smooth PC port for the most part. There is some screen tearing even at max settings. (i7 3770K 4.4 Ghz+Geforce 780 OC.) To my chagrin, it happens when the vsync is on from the game, or if Nvidia adaptive vsync is on, or if no vsync of any sort is on at all.

13613678,76561198007739156,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is the entry title into Metal Gear Solid V. Released as a standalone story, the game is offered to allow players early access to some of the features of the FOX Engine, as well as the new gameplay mechanics being released in The Phantom Pain.

The game offers a short story after the events of Peace Walker, as well as a few side missions. While the content is limited, there is a lot of content in the gameplay.

13609548,76561197965944462,"Great PROLOGUE to The Phantom Pain. (yes it has allot less content thats why its priced so low.)

GREAT port compared to the horrible and simply disgusting pc ports ubisoft has been releasing this year 2014.

i got this game to run on a dual core E6420 @2.4Ghz with amd 6970 with roughly 25-45 FPS @ 1080p.  (try doing that with ubi games)

on my main rig i got a solid 60 FPS with i7 2600K @ 4Ghz and a AMD 280x with graphic settings set to extra high/high mixed @ 1080p.


i played most of the game and im still nowhere near 100% completion, so the people saying this game is short need to boot up the game and dig deeper in the game because there is more to do then just the GZ mission.
the game is a bit repetetive after a while because you will need to do several playthroughs of each mission to get to 100% completion and all of it taking place in the same military base doesnt help.

+PROS

mouse keyboard controles are OK, but controller recommended.
lots of replay value
sandbox enviorment
great story for those who are cought up on the series
great stealth gameplay
lots of collectables
good AI on HARD mode
great music
nostalgia for those who played the other games
runs great on a wide variety of hardware
makes you thirsty for more ! (i guess you could also see this as a CON)

-CONS

default mouse keyboard controls could be better but actually not that bad its acceptable.
sometimes prompts are stuck on the screen
sometimes button inputs are buggy
auto cover system is a bit annoying at times
one or two extra missions would have been nice or access to a MGO beta
AMD seems to have a lack of Anti-Aliasing and slightly slower performance compared to Nvidia cards.

+ Weather effects look fantastic, and do much to add to the atmosphere

+ Voice-acting is top-notch, although I miss David Hayter (I won't count this as a negative, because Kiefer Sutherland voiced Snake, admittedly, well)
+ Controls are as solid as they get; did not feel one bit like a PC port, everything was mapped so naturally
+ The whole atmosphere stayed true to the spirit of the franchise; everthing form the dialogue, the movements, the cinematics and camera work - this game FEELS like an MGS title
+ Lengthy cinematics were absolutely phenomenal, and really pump you up for the full product (Phantom Payne, ETA 2015)

- Seems to be missing a few of the trademark nuances (e.g. knocking on walls, hiding in boxes, naked cartwheels)
- This is well-known, but the length is abysmal (you can beat the main story in less than 20 minutes); treat this like an interactive teaser-trailer, though, and this won't bother you as much

I beaten this on the console and I just did it again on the pc
It took me 45 mins gun blazing and done since i've played the hell out of it on my ps4.

The game environment and opening is amazing. The game is meant to be played the way you want to play it but mainly  it's  astealth game. I just felt like shooting everything down like an fps because iam mother fucking snake.

The new engine is amazing, the game is amazing however its shit short and you get what you paid for
Don't like? Don't waste the 17 dollars.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+ Graphics is immersive and fantastic.
+ Game Engine potential
+ Optimization on pc runs sexy as hell
+ Music in the game openinig made me shed a tear
+ Weather effects and environment
+ The amount of ways you can approach a situation, stealth, guns blazin, etc whatever.
+ Multiple missions you can take on the map to prolong playability

[h1] Cons [/h1]
- Its short you can literally try to speed run it in less than 1 hour 
- Its just a tech demo for the upcoming game

Alle Hagel  Hideo Kojima

and yes It does play like a damn fiddle.

You can finish the main mission in under 15 minutes easily, however It has an amazingly fun engine to play with, even though it's repetitive, you may never tire of playing it because there are so many things you can do.

The rating system is ret*rded and annoying though, I really hope they don't bring this into Phantom Pain, sometimes I just want to kill everyone and sometimes I want to play safe without being spotted, but I don't want to recieve a rating that isn't based on the playstyle that I chose, for instance, if you snipe everyone, go in guns blazing, speed run or take too long to finish because you were playing safe you'll probably recieve a bad rating, that's annoying.

13595076,76561198004783182,"Amazing return of the MGS series to PC. While having played only MGS and 2 on pc (no consoles), I am very lost in the story, but I refuse to read/watch it, I'll just wait for the collection to come to PC. This game is amazing and maintains the essence of MGS I remember back in the day when I played the aforementioned games. Controlling Snake feels pretty good both on keyboard+mouse and gamepay (started playing with a gamepad but moved to the GLORIOUS keyboard+mouse combination for controlling the character and being able to aim accurately). 

The main mission took me a while (probably 3 hours) because, since I am kinda ""new"" to the game, I wasn't quite used to the descriptions, so it took some time finding the targets. Side ops are taking me about 1 hour each. You then get to replay them in hard difficulty and you can try to beat your score to unlock extra content. There's  2 extra missions I haven't unlocked as you have to get all the XOF patches in one playthrough (which you can continue, of course) during the main mission. I'm looking forward to playing them.

Pros:
- graphics and optimization: is is how a port should work. 10/10
- voice acting by Keifer Sutherland
- lots of gameplay time for this so-called ""demo"" (by many idiots)
- different approaches to missions

Cons:
- CAMERA TOO DAMN CLOSE. Specially when carrying someone or while close to the wall. This DEFINITELY needs to be addressed.
- AI can be a bit stupid at times
- Controlling Snake some times can be annoying because he doesn't respond the way you intend him to.


All in all, get this game. It is on sale on many places!

13587296,76561197980859954,"Now THIS is how ports are meant to be made!

Being a [strike] obsessive [/strike] pretty big fan of MGS, I purchased the initial release of Ground Zeroes on the PS3 and 100%'d the game, leaving no stone unturned. The steam release for me was really a way of supporting development on The Phantom Pain as I didn't really think there much else I could experience that I haven't already done but boy was I wrong!

After 100%'ing the steam release of MGSV: GZ I'm happy to say I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this title to any Metal Gear fan or someone who's looking for a photo realistic, infiltration game with a lot of mystery.

Okay let's get the big obvious one out the way. You CAN complete the MAIN mission of this game in less than five minutes pretty easily but this is certainly a title of quality over quantity and considering the quality of this port? It's 5 fucking stars my friend!

The official reasoning of the existance of GZ as a standalone title when it was originally going to be a tutorial intro for TPP is that GZ is radically different in playstyle to previous MGS titles and the team wanted to ease people in to this new style of stealth. Let's be real, that's bull. GZ IS however a great test in which the team received A TONNE of data and a lot of finance for development of TPP and to me that's great! They made a solid experience with GZ and can take further refinements to make TPP even better! 

Ground Zeroes is a fantastic showcase of the Fox Engine's capabilities and how friendly it is for both developer and consumer! You take one look at GZ and you think ""Wow! VERY realistic graphics! Doubt my old spud of a PC could run that..."" and here's the beauty of this port, you most likely can. While I can run it on ultra and at a over 60 FPS average, I've seen people who don't even meet the MINIMUM specs on the store page and they run it absolutely fine! You don't need a silly SUPER ULTRA MEGA RAM THROTLING PHYSX 50GB VRAM 2 TITAN i7 10.00 Ghz setup at all and I find that jaw droppingly impressive, especially when GZ is practically Kojima Productions' first contribution to PC gaming for a LONG time (Like what? MGS 2 Substance??)

The gameplay (while taking a few moments to adjust if you've played MGS since the start) is great! You are truly in the thick of it and it is your decision making, actions and ability to adapt that'll decide on your success or failure. Gun handling and animations of you using them give you a respect for the weapon. I personally love seeing the sniper rifle on my back! While it is an offensive weapon and I like to ghost my runs, it's nice to just hold it!

The sound effects and graphics are amazing! GZ is a game about detail. Nothing is just simply slapped on or tacked in. It's there for a reason and it's done to a level of near perfection. For example, you have binoculars that are used to zoom in and scout enemies, vehicles and things like security cameras up ahead. You get a number of 2 zooms on it that really close in on your target. Now say you go and knock out a dude and you just feel like popping out the binos for a closer look-see. You instantly get a close up shot of the guys face but then you zoom in TWICE and the image is still SO clear to the point you actually see the pores of the person's skin, it's that crazy! And it's that level of detail in imagery and the believeable sound effects that accompany everything from the rain, to footsteps in the wet mud to footsteps on metallic stairs to even a light bulb beaming and it's hinges creaking when it turns! Nothing is left out. You get so much information as an infiltrationist that you can't help but be in the situation. You are there, feeling the wind and rain on your face, 

As a teaser for TPP, GZ does a lot to fuel the hype and while I DO have my issues as an MGS fan (My Snakeu~ voice) GZ is the level of quality and passion that I really wish will one day be the industry standard, because it's games like this that further the level and reason as to why games ARE the ultimate form of entertainment and immersion.

You instantly get a close up shot of the guys face but then you zoom in TWICE and the image is still SO clear to the point you actually see the pores of the person's skin, it's that crazy! And it's that level of detail in imagery and the believeable sound effects that accompany everything from the rain, to footsteps in the wet mud to footsteps on metallic stairs to even a light bulb beaming and it's hinges creaking when it turns! Nothing is left out. You get so much information as an infiltrationist that you can't help but be in the situation.

-You can attach C4 to a truck, drive it at a watch tower, then leap out of the truck and blow up the C4 and cause a base-wide alert that's totally worth the badassery as you watch the tower crumble and the truck explode.

13575776,76561197976081200,"First and foremost: this is a game based almost entirely off replay value, collectable hunting, and playing for score. If you do not enjoy these things, you may just want to wait for The Phantom Pain or pick this up cheap.

For the unintiated, Ground Zeroes is the first chapter to the Metal Gear Solid 5 narrative. The titular mission contains the actual plot and cutscenes you would expect from an MGS game, but be warned, it's the only mission with these qualities. The remaining handful of Side Ops and Extra Ops are basically fluff and so they do not contain very much story beyond basic briefings and ramblings over the radio as you play.

These additional missions, however, bring quite a bit of variety to the table. Along with completely different times of day and weather (all of which affect guard sight and hearing), you're presented with brand new objectives of all sorts of espionage-y type things. Collecting intel, destroying enemy assets, extracting prisoners, assassination, and even some oddball fanservice await you. While all of these missions take place on the same map, it doesn't hurt the game too badly as it is a surprisingly deep area with lots of routes and techniques to be discovered.

As previously mentioned, this is a game filled with replay value. A nice selection of collectables and unlockables are presented here, some of which even add to the greater narrative. Each mission can be played on Normal and Hard difficulties, which admittedly doesn't change up too much, other than guard perception and accuracy. Additionally, at the end of each mission, you are graded on your performance. Things like playing non-lethal, avoiding enemy alerts, and time taken are added up into a score and the game gives you a letter grade based on this. Interestingly, some missions actually have hidden objectives that you have to discover for yourself which add even more points to your score and even give you a collectable and narrative for your troubles.

But what about the gameplay itself, you say? It's good, basically. Snake is a very agile and resourceful guy and it's presented expertly through the controls (of which, the mouse and keyboard work nicely, barring some small issues). You've got your basic stealth game movements like crouching and crawling, as well as a brand new sprint function and a very useful dive; handy for diving into cover just before someone catches sight of you. The CQC system has been overhauled and is now, quite frankly, far better. While some miscellaneous moves have been removed, it's just plain old easier to get Snake to do what you want now, rather than fumbling around and accidentally killing someone.

Gunplay in this chapter is the best in the series, hands down. It's setup similarly to MGS4 but now much faster and easier to get on target. This results in the feeling that Snake is actually that legendary soldier everyone claims him to be. This, of course, extends to the obligatory tranquilizer gun which now has a much slower flying round and even pretty severe drop to compensate for how powerful it can be. No longer can you just place a laser sight on the enemy's head and knock them out, you must actively compensate for range and movement. The game also features a pretty handy little recon system where spotting an enemy through your binoculars or just giving them a good look can mark them, allowing you to view them through walls while in close proximity. While some players may offer the opinion that this makes the game too easy, the act of actually doing recon to gain these abilities makes it much more than just a cheat. Reflex Mode is another new addition to help players out, slowing time down to a crawl if they're spotted so they can attempt to silence the guard before he gives them away. Thankfully, the option to disable these and all the other sneaking aids in the game is offered.

The camo system of MGS3 and 4 has been removed in favor of a more natural approach to stealth, almost in line with the older Splinter Cell games. The lower your stance, the harder you are to see. Shadows and bushes can also be used to conceal your presence. Guards in this iteration are much more capable than they were in previous MGS games as well. Their sight ranges and detection capabilities are far greater than any previous Metal Gear Solid and they generally behave a whole lot more realistically as a consequence. This can make sneaking in feel very slow paced and tense but incredibly fun to pull off. Additionally, if you just feel like going in loud, you'll probably enjoy yourself too. Guards now put up a much better fight over long range and offer a very satisfying reaction to being shot, each hit providing varied feedback beyond the typical ""hurt"" animation. (Also, the headshot sound is up there with Counter-Strike's in terms of sheer morbid pleasure.)

The game isn't without it's problems too. Guard behavior can feel clueless occasionally and their ability to randomly turn their heads to look around and do different animations can actually mess up speedrun-y tactics that worked the last few retries. The Camp Omega map isn't quite big enough in my opinion and it definitely starts to feel same-y after 10 to 20 hours of attempting to 100% the game. The PC port has no mouse controlled menus but the WASD and mouse click controlled alternative isn't terrible. Mouse aim doesn't scale for zoom, meaning aiming through scopes or just the zoomed in binoculars is incredibly twitchy and hard to get on target. There's also, inexplicably, no toggle binoculars key, meaning you have to awkwardly hold down the F key the entire time you're using them. This wouldn't be too bad if you could put the binoculars function on an additional mouse button but the game doesn't support binding to Mouse 4 and 5 either.

If you're a die-hard MGS fan, you've probably already played this on your console of choice but if you waited patiently for the PC release, you really should pick up this version. It's amazingly well optimized, only demanding a DX11-capable graphics card and a 64-bit OS. If you meet those requirements, you can run this. The graphics menu is deep enough to get this beast working on any toaster and those with monster rigs will get the eye-candy they seek. Admittedly, the graphics menu has a few problems like clumping depth of field, motion blur, and post-processing anti-aliasing together into one setting but these can be (mostly) forgiven based on just how nicely it runs. You might even be surprised at how high you can turn the settings up.

Overall, Ground Zeroes is a promising tease of open world MGS, reaching Hitman-esque levels of techniques to beat each mission. If a game this sparse can provide that amount of depth, it's hard not to be excited for The Phantom Pain and its expanded sandbox.",1419453516,1419619369,1,0.5,1630,1464,1456795101,"{""recommendationid"": ""13575776"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197976081200"", ""num_games_owned"": 738, ""num_reviews"": 39, ""playtime_forever"": 1630, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 1464, ""last_played"": 1456795101}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""First and foremost: this is a game based almost entirely off replay value, collectable hunting, and playing for score.

*ahem ahem*
Ok so this is an Amazing Game Done right on PC. for a port, it's surprisingly outstanding.
Metal Gear Solid V, despite numbered '5', it's not a sequel to MGS4, but rather a direct sequel to Peace Walker. (Name it Peace Walker 2)
I think people who skipped Peace Walker will miss many things and won't have the same experience.
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLAYING BIG BOSS SAGA GAMES BEFORE PLAYING THIS OR PHANTOM PAIN.

Out of the technical and background info side:
[h1]------What's to expect?[/h1]
Imagine Hideo Kojima used ""Polymerization Card"" fusing Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell.
Yes, Actually Ground Zeroes don't play much like the older games. it borrowed many things from Splinter Cell games, most notably Blacklist, and built them upon Peace Walker.
This Game will give you 2-Hours (more or less) ""Main Ops"" mission. That's is the entrance to The Phantom Pain.
when you finish that, you will be given 4 ""Side Ops"" missions to complete and that for the rest of hours for your money.
Finding Certain Collectibles will give you 2 ""Extra Ops"", and these two for old fans. they are filled with ""nostalgia"" moments, easter eggs, and jokes only old fans will get.
  
[h1]------What's Good?[/h1]
-A Thrilling story with a great cliffhanger : Note, Probably only those who at least have a background about Snake Eater, Portable Ops and Peace Walker will get hooked into GZ/PP story. 
-Breathtaking 60FPS Gameplay.
-Absolutely reliable and great Controls for Keyboard/Mouse, i played the first hours using Xbox 360 Controllers, but honestly it not that good. Aiming soldiers by Tranq.Gun using stick is a pain in the a$$.
-semi-Free Roam gameplay with vehicles to use for transportations or giving hell to soldiers.
-Realistic environment and Realistic mechanism
-The Ambient, the environment sounds, They Sound unbelievably realistic.
-Graphics are top notch!
-Challenging Missions.

[h1]------What's Bad (a.k.a Personal letdowns)?[/h1]
-Story is found in just few scenes.
-No Fulton Recovery System (Peace Walker's POW recovery system)
-Very limited weapons to use
-Soldiers have really ""over-miles"" eyes, and you don't have a big chances to avoid alerts. Yes, they can see you from very long distance, and this made me suffer of repeating missions countless of times just to achieve no-detection mission completion.
-unmerciful towards achieving S rank

[h1]------What's to do?[/h1]
-If you are new to MGS series, i suggest you skip this game. and Begin playing MGS games in this order
MGS3 Subsistence, Portable Ops, Peace Walker, then this, then wait until Phantom Pain, and continue from there into Solid Snake Games.
-If you played MGS Games but didn't give chance to the (less popular) titles of Portable Ops and Peace Walker
do it now, and this play this game. they are really games with great storylines.

Believe me, you will miss out A TONS OF TONS of the story, easter eggs and many other things if you don't.

final words.......

The hardware optimization is very well done, the game runs smoothly and has no issues with FPS drops. The graphics are gorgeous with some nice lighting effects and good use of DoF. 

The controls optimization for PC is different story altogether, the controls are clunky at best, default key binds are odd, no optimization to use extra mouse buttons or the scroll button.

 [*]Unbelievable optimization for the PC, the game runs smoothly without any FPS drops.
 [*]Great graphics and sound effects.
 [*]Realistic bullet drop.

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
 [*]The game is short, there is only main mission and few more side ops, all in the same zone. This might not necessarily be a bad thing, because of the replayability, but there will be some pissed off people if you don’t put a big warning in the description.
 [*]The AI in this game is quite stupid, those soldiers with rocket launchers will often kill themselves or their teammates. 
 [*]Guards on the towers ignore killed / disabled enemies on the ground, even when they have clear line of sight. 
 [*][spoiler]Skull Face… seriously skull face? If you have to go for tacky villain at least slap a cape on him…[/spoiler]
 [*]Some features from previous games seems to be missing, leaning corners, ability to shoot weapon / radio out of someone’s hand, knocking on the wall, etc.
 [*]If you stack more than 3 disabled enemies, they will disappear, it is easy to forget somebody on the ground who will appear later just to be discovered by patrolling soldiers.
 [*]Soldiers can see through some walls or closed doors.
 [*]The save (checkpoint) system is well weird at best. If you load checkpoint you sometimes get spawned in completely different area, even one you have not visited yet, on top of that some enemies will rise from the dead and man their posts again. You also hear the scripted radio communications every time and it gets old really quick. The random spawning happens even if you specifically run to the place where the game saves.
 [*]Game does not adjust the mouse speed when zoomed in with scope or binoculars.
 [*]The camera is abysmal in some situations, often you can’t see anything at all. Especially some tight spaces are really tough on the camera control.
 [*]No mouse navigation in menus and iDroid (iDroid, really?).
 [*]The grab / interrogate / kill menu is terrible.
 [*]Menus within menus within menus WTF?
 [*]No support to bind actions to your extra mouse buttons.
 [*]There is no sound menu (2014 WTF?).
 [*]Do we really have to confirm everything in the menus 3 times?
 [*]My mouse has a scroll button, please put it to work.
 [*]Not the best KBM controls, you can line up a headshot point blank from the cover, adjust for the targets movement and watch the bullet magically miss.
 [*]No separate key for ducking? Why isn’t the jump assigned to space by default? There is no button to go to cover, the game randomly decides whether your character will or will not jump to cover.
 [*]The gameplay hints / command tutorials doesn’t adjust for KBM users, the controls are displayed for controller only.

13572215,76561198099934365,"Metal Gear Solid V. It's pretty hard to reccomend the game, since what I saw from the trailers and even someone from the studio play it [i]doesn't tell you everything[/i]. In fact, there are many many many things that are mislead during gameplay. There are in fact restrictions, there are limits, and there are certainly some frustrating moments. I will get to those after I peel what is good in the game.

The graphics in the game are absolutly flawless. Very, very well made art and the level design is great. The grass is swaying, and many of the animations are on point. There are things that bugged me though, one of them being that the animations just loop, but it's hard to tell. Another one, and I have been meaning to get to this since the beginning, [b]there is only [i]one[/i] level[/b]. One. That's it. And this just made me so POd when I found out. The side ops are the same damn map the whole way. It does get old after the 2nd side op. Well that's really it for the graphics.

How about the restrictions? Ah, yes. There are indeed restrictions. For example, if you shoot the target, mission is over. If the target dies, mission over. Sure, your helicopter can be blown up, but you get punished for it at the end because it deducts points from you. How is that not a restriction? That really disappointed me when I bought the game expecting not to have any restrictions. Oh yeah, you can't leaave the mission area... or you fail. Yeah, that's not right.

Moving on, the voice acting is incredibly done, as was all of the MG games. Rising, solid, you name it, I think it has really good voice acting. The scripted speeches, you know, the ones where the enemy spots you and radios in, those get repetitive. There are no variations to those lines at all. ""This is CP - Understood!"" never changes. It's the same guy that says it in the same tone the whole game. No variation at all, and I believe that could have been changed.

Also, the amount of bugs I encountered just by starting the game out was disappointing. I could not use my controller for  [i]THREE[/i] reasons. The first one was because the control scheme isn't what it says it is. It says that ""Y"" is to use but the ""DPAD DOWN"" button actually uses. The shoot button is right trigger, sure, but aim is ""START"". Like, that's poor programming right there. Also, I can't really play the game with my controller anyway, since my mouse gets in the game and the camera is forced to be looking up. Can't move or look around at all. So, if you are buying the game for the controller, don't, otherwise you will be so disappointed. Let's move on the the keyboard and mouse controls. I could not get this until I started the game up the 5th time. You can't use a controller. Duh. You know that now. It breaks the game. So being forced to use a keyboard for a console-made game, was not a good concept for me. However, when I tried it, it seemed to integrate flawlessly with keyboard and mouse controls. Even so, it's going to take some getting used to. First off, there are no cover buttons; you have to move up against a wall to take cover, and hold your walk button to get even close to the side of the cover. The dash button says it needs to be held, but the only way to get out of dash mode is to either change stance (crouch) or to tap your walk button, which isn't a bother for me. I made it through the first 15 minutes of figuring out the controls, but I never knew I needed to hold the change stance button to prone. I mean, it's plausable, but still, I think there could've been at least an option maybe to have a prone button? I don't know. Oh well, like I said, you can't just jump in and play on a keyboard; you have to get used to it first. Not so many flaws, but the ""ready weapon"" while proned is very annoying. If I wanted to lay on my side and start shooting *just* out of my cover, but I need to move a little bit to the right, oh no. There goes my ""on the side"" technique. Now I am getting shot at from all over. But that's very minor and that's what the actual cover system is for.

Mechanics are a very hard spot of the game; very hard to get perfect, yet easy to bring down the quality of the game. Personally, I have found no problems with the mechanics of the game, besides having the weird menu where you have to use the WASD keys to navigate. Also, if you complete a certain mission, some guy that you rescue is actually ON THE SCREEN in the main menu! I only wanted Snake to be on there! Not this guy no one knows about! Anyway, like I said, no real problems with the mechanics that I could see. You can crawl under buildings and climb over things, you can carry and throw bodies, you can hang off of the only cliff in the game and fall directly into the ocean where it automaticly kills you, etc. Dying isn't really a problem besides the score deduction at the end. It doesn't take too long to get back in the action. The loading screens are actually interactive with hints that you can use the arrow keys to switch hints and read through them. A problem I have found is that it is not very easy to ""stick someone up"" by holding a gun to their head. I got right behind someone and held a gun to their face, but no, I go into reflex mode and end up shooting the guy. I tried the same thing with at least 5 other soldiers but with the same result. Let's go on to the story.

The story is actually pretty good. There is a backstory, too, since that's what Metal Gear is all about. But one thing that just really, really, REALLY disappoints me, is... [b]THERE IS ONLY ONE, AND ONLY ONE STORY MISSION![/b] Why? That pissed me off! That was very disappointing, and I would have liked more. There's even a cutscene with Snake in a coma for 9 years. That's a very annoying loose end! How did he get into the coma? Since this isn't revealed in the plot itself, I wouldn't consider this a spoiler. That drove me crazy. I can't comprehend why they would take the story and just take a shit on it like that. One mission. Really? The rest are side ops. Even the side ops could be tied in with the story! They were so good. ""Rescue this guy named, Jarry let's call him, and he has a tape that contains an interrogation between some guy we need to kill and another guy we need to capture"" would have been a great objective and might have tied in with the story had it been given some polish. When someone needs to make up a story because a game's side mission could be a part of the story just means that the developers didn't do a very good job with it, and that is bringing down my final score. Speaking of which...

The game is beautiful on the outside, but the devs totally mislead you into buying the game and getting you disappointed. This really pissed me off, but hey, it's still really fun to just sneak around or go in guns blazing and I had a ton of fun playing this game and I still am having fun. That being said, the game is actually pretty good, but not what was expected from the trailers and the dev notes bringing this score to a [b][i][u]7/10.[/b][/i]/u] If I played the game and there were more story missions, [i]more maps and not the same cheap-ass map over and over again[/i] then it probably would have gotten a higher score and my 3 Thumbs Up mark, but it's not what was expected and it could have been polished a bit more, however it is still a good game and I think that people that just want to pretend the story is not there and you want to play something like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, then I highly reccomend it. If you are looking for a game with a well thought out story and plentiful maps, then I suggest looking for another game. Thanks for reading my long-ass review and I hope this helped a bit.",1419442576,1419442576,1,0.523809552192688,1302,314,1511635350,"{""recommendationid"": ""13572215"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198099934365"", ""num_games_owned"": 1103, ""num_reviews"": 20, ""playtime_forever"": 1302, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 314, ""last_played"": 1511635350}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Metal Gear Solid V. It's pretty hard to reccomend the game, since what I saw from the trailers and even someone from the studio play it [i]doesn't tell you everything[/i]. In fact, there are many many many things that are mislead during gameplay. There are in fact restrictions, there are limits, and there are certainly some frustrating moments. I will get to those after I peel what is good in the game.\n\nThe graphics in the game are absolutly flawless. Very, very well made art and the level design is great. The grass is swaying, and many of the animations are on point. There are things that bugged me though, one of them being that the animations just loop, but it's hard to tell. Another one, and I have been meaning to get to this since the beginning, [b]there is only [i]one[/i] level[/b]. One. That's it. And this just made me so POd when I found out. The side ops are the same damn map the whole way. It does get old after the 2nd side op. Well that's really it for the graphics.\n\nHow about the restrictions? Ah, yes. There are indeed restrictions. For example, if you shoot the target, mission is over. If the target dies, mission over. Sure, your helicopter can be blown up, but you get punished for it at the end because it deducts points from you. How is that not a restriction? That really disappointed me when I bought the game expecting not to have any restrictions. Oh yeah, you can't leaave the mission area... or you fail. Yeah, that's not right.\n\nMoving on, the voice acting is incredibly done, as was all of the MG games. Rising, solid, you name it, I think it has really good voice acting. The scripted speeches, you know, the ones where the enemy spots you and radios in, those get repetitive. There are no variations to those lines at all. \""This is CP - Understood!\"" never changes. It's the same guy that says it in the same tone the whole game. No variation at all, and I believe that could have been changed.\n\nAlso, the amount of bugs I encountered just by starting the game out was disappointing. I could not use my controller for  [i]THREE[/i] reasons. The first one was because the control scheme isn't what it says it is. It says that \""Y\"" is to use but the \""DPAD DOWN\"" button actually uses. The shoot button is right trigger, sure, but aim is \""START\"". Like, that's poor programming right there. Also, I can't really play the game with my controller anyway, since my mouse gets in the game and the camera is forced to be looking up. Can't move or look around at all. So, if you are buying the game for the controller, don't, otherwise you will be so disappointed. Let's move on the the keyboard and mouse controls. I could not get this until I started the game up the 5th time. You can't use a controller. Duh. You know that now. It breaks the game. So being forced to use a keyboard for a console-made game, was not a good concept for me. However, when I tried it, it seemed to integrate flawlessly with keyboard and mouse controls. Even so, it's going to take some getting used to. First off, there are no cover buttons; you have to move up against a wall to take cover, and hold your walk button to get even close to the side of the cover. The dash button says it needs to be held, but the only way to get out of dash mode is to either change stance (crouch) or to tap your walk button, which isn't a bother for me. I made it through the first 15 minutes of figuring out the controls, but I never knew I needed to hold the change stance button to prone. I mean, it's plausable, but still, I think there could've been at least an option maybe to have a prone button? I don't know. Oh well, like I said, you can't just jump in and play on a keyboard; you have to get used to it first. Not so many flaws, but the \""ready weapon\"" while proned is very annoying. If I wanted to lay on my side and start shooting *just* out of my cover, but I need to move a little bit to the right, oh no. There goes my \""on the side\"" technique. Now I am getting shot at from all over. But that's very minor and that's what the actual cover system is for.\n\nMechanics are a very hard spot of the game; very hard to get perfect, yet easy to bring down the quality of the game. Personally, I have found no problems with the mechanics of the game, besides having the weird menu where you have to use the WASD keys to navigate. Also, if you complete a certain mission, some guy that you rescue is actually ON THE SCREEN in the main menu! I only wanted Snake to be on there! Not this guy no one knows about! Anyway, like I said, no real problems with the mechanics that I could see. You can crawl under buildings and climb over things, you can carry and throw bodies, you can hang off of the only cliff in the game and fall directly into the ocean where it automaticly kills you, etc. Dying isn't really a problem besides the score deduction at the end. It doesn't take too long to get back in the action. The loading screens are actually interactive with hints that you can use the arrow keys to switch hints and read through them. A problem I have found is that it is not very easy to \""stick someone up\"" by holding a gun to their head. I got right behind someone and held a gun to their face, but no, I go into reflex mode and end up shooting the guy. I tried the same thing with at least 5 other soldiers but with the same result. Let's go on to the story.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good. There is a backstory, too, since that's what Metal Gear is all about. But one thing that just really, really, REALLY disappoints me, is... [b]THERE IS ONLY ONE, AND ONLY ONE STORY MISSION![/b] Why? That pissed me off! That was very disappointing, and I would have liked more. There's even a cutscene with Snake in a coma for 9 years. That's a very annoying loose end! How did he get into the coma? Since this isn't revealed in the plot itself, I wouldn't consider this a spoiler. That drove me crazy. I can't comprehend why they would take the story and just take a shit on it like that. One mission. Really? The rest are side ops. Even the side ops could be tied in with the story! They were so good. \""Rescue this guy named, Jarry let's call him, and he has a tape that contains an interrogation between some guy we need to kill and another guy we need to capture\"" would have been a great objective and might have tied in with the story had it been given some polish.

13563246,76561198046099185,"**The thumbs up is a little more complex than it seems. I really wish Steam would implement a middle ground choice.**

Being a noob to the MGS series, I felt that this was a pretty good place to start, based on the very positive reviews (especially when talking about the optimization of the PC port). I was excited to try it out, and after a couple frustrating hours of trying to fix control bugs, I was in. 

First of all, the game is drop-dead gorgeous. Kojima Productions really shows the modern-day AAA dev how to make a PC port correctly. As far as I can tell, the game as a whole runs beautifully on almost any gaming machine you throw it at. My mid-high range system runs the game maxed out at 50-60 fps consistently. The production values really shine through on this one. The cut-scenes and voice acting are just as ingaging as the gameplay itself. 

Being new to the series, I had a little trouble getting into the mind set of a MGS game, but once I was there, I was hooked. The controls feel really intuitive and moving Snake around the open enviornment works really well. From what I can tell, this entry takes the mechanics of previous MGS games and puts them into an open-world eske enviornment, where you can take on missions the way YOU want to play. Want to feel like a spy, infultraiting a base with high-skill and finesse? You can do that. Want to go in guns blaizing and blow up every red barrel in sight? You can do that too. Most likely with little sucess, but you can do it. This is a really good look at how MGS V The Phantom Pain will play.

But that's the problem. The game feels like a sneak peak to The Phantom Pain. I felt as though I did very poorly in the game, dying a lot and I only really focused on getting to my objectives. And still, my game time came out to around 1.5 hours. I don't really feel like I got my moneys worth, even at the $13 sale. Now keep in mind, I've never played the MGS series, so that may alter my final views on the game, but from what I played, I feel like this is an overpriced demo. If it was $10 normally, I would have no problems, because I feel that even with the short play time, the production values and the quality of the port make it worth that.

But seeing how that isn't the case, I would be very careful recommending this to someone. If you are a fan of the series and can't wait for the Phantom Pain to come out, go ahead and get it. You will probably get more enjoyment out of it than I did and justify the $20. But if you aren't a fan of the series, wait till it goes on sale around $10 again.

Don't get me wrong. I really did enjoy my time with Ground Zeroes. The gameplay feels really nice, the world it presents is gorgeous and complex, and the production values are through the f***ing roof. But since the game's total play time doesn't neccesarily coinside with the normal $20 price tag, I would have a hard time recommending this game to people who had a similar gaming background and taste to my own.

Pros:
-The world is immersive and drop dead gorgeous
-Hands down one of the best optimizations of a PC port from a AAA dev in the past several years
-Fun and exciting gameplay that allows you to play MGS the way you want to play
-Amazing production values

Cons:

I really wish Steam would implement a middle ground choice.**\n\nBeing a noob to the MGS series, I felt that this was a pretty good place to start, based on the very positive reviews (especially when talking about the optimization of the PC port). I was excited to try it out, and after a couple frustrating hours of trying to fix control bugs, I was in. \n\nFirst of all, the game is drop-dead gorgeous. Kojima Productions really shows the modern-day AAA dev how to make a PC port correctly. As far as I can tell, the game as a whole runs beautifully on almost any gaming machine you throw it at. My mid-high range system runs the game maxed out at 50-60 fps consistently. The production values really shine through on this one. The cut-scenes and voice acting are just as ingaging as the gameplay itself. \n\nBeing new to the series, I had a little trouble getting into the mind set of a MGS game, but once I was there, I was hooked. The controls feel really intuitive and moving Snake around the open enviornment works really well. From what I can tell, this entry takes the mechanics of previous MGS games and puts them into an open-world eske enviornment, where you can take on missions the way YOU want to play. Want to feel like a spy, infultraiting a base with high-skill and finesse? You can do that. Want to go in guns blaizing and blow up every red barrel in sight? You can do that too. Most likely with little sucess, but you can do it. This is a really good look at how MGS V The Phantom Pain will play.\n\nBut that's the problem. The game feels like a sneak peak to The Phantom Pain. I felt as though I did very poorly in the game, dying a lot and I only really focused on getting to my objectives. And still, my game time came out to around 1.5 hours. I don't really feel like I got my moneys worth, even at the $13 sale. Now keep in mind, I've never played the MGS series, so that may alter my final views on the game, but from what I played, I feel like this is an overpriced demo. If it was $10 normally, I would have no problems, because I feel that even with the short play time, the production values and the quality of the port make it worth that.\n\nBut seeing how that isn't the case, I would be very careful recommending this to someone. If you are a fan of the series and can't wait for the Phantom Pain to come out, go ahead and get it. You will probably get more enjoyment out of it than I did and justify the $20. But if you aren't a fan of the series, wait till it goes on sale around $10 again.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I really did enjoy my time with Ground Zeroes. The gameplay feels really nice, the world it presents is gorgeous and complex, and the production values are through the f***ing roof. But since the game's total play time doesn't neccesarily coinside with the normal $20 price tag, I would have a hard time recommending this game to people who had a similar gaming background and taste to my own.\n\nPros:\n-The world is immersive and drop dead gorgeous\n-Hands down one of the best optimizations of a PC port from a AAA dev in the past several years\n-Fun and exciting gameplay that allows you to play MGS the way you want to play\n-Amazing production values\n\nCons:\n-No benchmarking mode(this game really deserves one)\n-IMO the amount of content won't be enough to justify the $20 price tag\n-I experienced some bugs with the controls making the game unplayable, but eventually fixed them. Seems to be a case by case issue that can be patched in.\n\n-If you are a huge MGS fan, go ahead and get it.

That is all this game is, except instead of getting different locations there is only one location.  Hideo Kojima who made Metal Gear has been around alot longer than Overkill and should know more about game design but here on PC we get ONE map, oh gee thanks Kojima.

This game is more like the Sniper Challenge which was free as a preorder bonus for Hitman.  It was one map with alot of stuff to do, lots of records to go for and trials, exactly like this game except for Hitman it was FREE.  This is just stupid, after finishing the first mission, I thought alright lets see whats next, but its the same thing, the same place.

This game feels like some weird hybrid mix of a poor mans splinter cell and assassins creed.  There are takedowns like assassins creed if you stand behind a wall or around a corner, wow so NOT original.  Checking the reviews for this game their ALL positive, many saying, ""The game works"", or ""awesome graphics"".  Is that the standard for PC gaming?  That it just ""works""?  

Thats a bold faced lie the controls are crap, you hit ""B"" to reload, in what world is that the reload button?  The controls are like their from 1987 when Metal Gear was first released.  There is no duck button, he will arbitrarily decide to move into cover or not.  Its completely random, this game is very random.  When diving he seems to randomly decide to just get back up and get shot or stay down, its a crazy random thing where you feel completely out of control.  The AI is borderline stupid, setting the industry back at least 5-7 years.  Typical AI if they hear a sound everyone knows right where you are, they can see through walls even.  A clear example of bad AI is the rocket launcher soldiers that are so Gung Ho as marines they will fire a rocket in your direction hitting a wall or another of their marines right in front of them killing themself their friends everybody, those Marines are pretty hardcore. The camera sucks, often you cant see around anything or anywhere really.  Just like sniper elite, the enemies simply run back and forth shooting at you from so far away their almost not even visible, just small blobs of what could be a person.   So great the game works, it runs, the rest of it sucks.  

And the menus in this game!  dear god, its like playing on windows with UAC turned on, everything must be confirmed.  The game doesnt even start unless you press a button.  There is no hot swapping of weapons, to switch your main weapons you press ""up"" on the dpad twice, why twice?  Why not once?  Actually had friends over and discussed how the person who made the menus for this game must have spent their days figuring out every conceivable way make their job more important by making more and more menus, popups, confirmations, and useless screens that say press a button to continue.

For people who like this thats great then get Payday 2 which is half the price has online, co-op, and even stealth, its the SAME game basically.  MGSV shoulda been a free preorder bonus for a REAL game like it was with Sniper Challenge for Hitman.  Not some cheap way to rip off gamers, specially not nice to do around Christmas when gamers could be getting games to play for longer times, year round, at lower prices.

Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Fox Engine might be my new favorite. lol

Even when it's set to low, it's still stunning. The way it can scale and all the stuff, amazing.

Fantastic. Every little detail, from rain hitting the surface to far off distant yawn. Well done.

[h1]Other Stuff[/h1]
At the time of posting/playing this. My PC's specs are:
AMD Phenom II x4 955 @ 3.2Ghz
4GB of RAM
AMD/ATi 6770

After tweaking some graphic settings, it'll run very smooth. I did lock FPS at 30, I did this to prevent any unexpecting issues. So, if you're wondering if your PC can run it and you have similar specs. Here's your answer. :)

There is plenty of replay too. Stuff like Side Ops and Extra Ops. Or maybe you're a trial record setter or an achievement hunter. There is still tons of stuff you can do.

If the quality of this is the same for The Phantom Pain, then that will be fantastic aswell.

MGSV:GZ has all the gameplay qualities that most of you have come to expect from the MGS series. Ground Zeroes is a great looking game, especially if you are running it from a mid-high tier machine or above. It's very well optimized and shows noticeable improvement from it's console counterpart.

If you're into the MGS series this is an easy recommendation, but every one needs to be aware that your first play through will only be between 2-4 hours depending on how you play. It's not a lot, and certainly much less from what we've come to be used to from AAA release. But the game does offer multiple ways to play, and gives incentive to multiple playthroghs. If you are to look at a game like Transistor which is about the same price, it also only has 2-4 hours first time through. From that perspective I feel I can still recommend MGSV:GZ even with it's short play time.

Overall I enjoyed what the game had to offer and I am very very excited for the Phantom Pain

Pros:
- Great visuals
- Great optimization for the PC
- Classic MGS gameplay
- Multiple ways to play, multiple playthrough possibilities

Yes this game only has one Level in the Main mission which is then used as a base level for the rest of the side missions (Side Ops) how ever there is more then 1 hours worth of game play.

The new graphics engine shows some real potential and is not locked down to 30 FPS although there is an option to do so. Game play is fluid and fun. The also has an Option to skip the cinematics which is a bonus!!.

Can't feign death.
*1 Can't antagonize held up enemies by aiming the gun at certain body parts.
Can't judo/knock a weapon out of someone's hand.
Can't hold more than one weapon.
*1 Can't shake enemies down for extra ammo/items.
Can't lean corners.
Can't shoot a gun out of someone's hand.
Can't shoot a radio out of someone's hand.
Can't shoot a grenade on person/hand and watch it explode.
(controller) There's 3 buttons that don't do anything when in standard/idle position. (Hey maybe that could of been a cover button?)
Can't blind fire around the corner.
Can't knock on walls. (That's fucking trademark to the metal gear series and this is the only one with out it.)
Mah knife.
Keifer Sutherland sounds like generic soldier #8, forgetable.
Can't slide. (Exlusive to MGS4)

Other gripes:
Seems to be only one mouse sensitivity level for looking/hip/aim. Very akward unless you got a mouse with adjustable DPI.
The auto covers is annoying as hell.
Aiming directly horizontal from cover will still put your head up. (This wasn't an issue in MGS4)

The game is tailored to multi-platform use which is not good because originally was played by a controller with sensitivity levels on all the buttons, which by the way had different variations in actions on the amount of pressure delievered to the button, and is now losed to xinput/keyboard nonsense. I don't mind playing my fps with a mouse, but when you need to do several different actions at once while shooting a controller is easier.

Gameplay: The controls are excellent, there's no more countdown timer or mini-map. This game seems to be more realistic than the previous ones. It feels like a real Metal Gear, but obviously different. The motions feel very fluid when compared to the other Metal Gears. This is a new generation that expects different things. It has to change to not become tiring and it has done a great job at that. There were some areas where I thought Kojima went too far, such as the tape you listen to from Chico. And the helicopter scene with Paz. It's basically forced torture to say the least. I can't give the game a higher rating than 8 because of those just disturbing things.

Issues: My main issue was that I have AMD hardware and this game doesn't seem to have been tested or implemented correctly on AMD desktop architecture hardware . The consoles this game is on does use AMD hardware, but a different architecture than used in PC's. The game suffers from a memory leak on this hardware it may depend on which type of AMD graphics cards you have, but on mine (R9 290) and others have also said the same thing about this problem.

basicly it's just one island, slightly large adult-playground with several missions and infinite possibilities. i've played mgs 1 and 2 on pc. my mind blew back then, double time, now it gets to blow again. you play as the legendary hero, snake, dropped in to an island and got to carry out several missions. whole island is your playground, you get to choose how to carry out the mission, even whom to carry inside the extraction chopper. yes! even dead bodies.

pros:
[list]
    [*]awesome graphics of fox game engine. even my laptop(msi gt780dxr) is way below min settings written in store page, i was able to pay in highest settings with no lags. so no worries, your wooden pc might be able to run it.
    [*]freedom. ahhh sweet smell of democracy on a u.s. base, however you want. roleplay as snake, or call of duty style, heck even go jackie chan on enemies. blow stuff up, or go silent.
    [*]moar freedom. get inside an armored vehicle and travel around the enemy base with ease.

I point this out, because for the past few months, PC Gaming has had a mean streak with ports (a lot of them coming from our favorite publisher, Ubisoft) in which potentially good or bad games are immediately hampered with frames per second rates so bad I feel like I'm playing a stop motion film. It's almost like Kojima saw this, and thought ""It's time"", and released this to show that ""Hey, Phantom Pain is still coming to PC, and we're not going to drop the ball on this. Don't believe us?

Onto the actual game: This is the infamous ""2-hour game for $20"", originally going to be priced at $30. Take that what you will. People will argue that it has a fantastic replayability, and it does, it really does, but that doesn't necessary take away from the fact that the actual story campaign is very minimal and doesn't quite contribute as much as it should have. We came here with a dozen questions, and left with a hundred more. 

That being said, the brief time I've played this game on just the main mission has been incredible simply for how flexible everything plays out. Say you wanted to do a completely non-lethal approach on a mission. 
And then there's the side-ops. These are missions that don't take you to a new map, mind you, but give you different kinds of objectives to approach. Kill a guy here, retrieve some intel there, etc. There's even a nice not-so-little cameo appearance from our favorite Japanese video game director. 
In my opinion, to get through all the content in and outside of the main mission, it will take you longer than 2 hours, especially if you want to try experimenting with different playthroughs or want to achieve S rank in everything. It would be much better if the side-ops were integrated more into the main story rather than just non-canon side quests like the way they are now, but it's something of a very small sample to what Phantom Pain is going to turn out to be, and the future looks bright. 
Overall, Ground Zeroes proves to be a phenomenal prologue that gives a lot of hope for the main entry, in which we'll see Big Boss in his transformation stages to the villanous character of the early Metal Gear games.

The FOX engine runs very well on the PC, zero crashes or stutter whatsoever, looks great and most importantly it's a blast to play.

This is a shining example on how ports should be done!

The game runs flawlessly with incredible graphics. If you have a higher power PC capable of the full 4K graphics your mind will be blown.

On the otehr hand if you're a Metal Gear fan with a PC (and haven't bought this for console already) I highly recommend this game!

The port is excellent, can't argue with that.
Controls are suprisingly comftrable with keyboard and mouse. Alltho there is always option to play with controller.

Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is the tenth canonical Metal Gear game and the prologue to the upcoming The Phantom Pain.

In case you don't know it, the game takes place after the events of Peace Walker, and it is set in Omega Camp, an American military base in which are imprisoned Chico and Paz, and Snake has to save them.
 
The game contains a total of 7 missions, including Deja-Vu and Jamais-Vu. If you are a completionist and trial lover, this game has plenty of replay value: the main mission takes around 30 to 60 minutes to complete, while the side missions range from 10 to 40 minutes, with a total of at least 7 hours of gameplay, excluding collectables, different strategies, trials and 16 Steam achievements to unlock.

The game uses the Fox Engine, which revolves around realistic lighting and shadow casting. The gameplay is simply perfect: every gun handles really well, CQC is really fluid, driving vehicles is fun and beating the game without being spotted is incredibly rewarding.

The graphics have been greatly improved and look gorgeous on the highest settings. The game is also very well optimised, and even a small laptop can play it with a solid 60fps on Low.

There are, however, some problems with this port.[strike] First of all, the shell casings don't show up when you shoot, the reload animations of the handguns don't work properly and the infamous right arm glitch when carrying people is still present. This are, however, some small bugs that can easily be fixed in a future patch.[/strike] The worst feature that is absent in this version is the custom music for the helicopter: you can only use the music used in the game, not custom tracks on your computer. Again, I hope that this gets fixed in a future patch.

Overall, this is a technical marvel and the most replayable Metal Gear game. This is quite easily my Game of The Year, and a perfect game.

13518690,76561198042952671,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is the next installment in Hideo Kojima's long lasting Metal Gear/Metal Gear Solid series.

This entry into the series continues where the previous game, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, left off. The strange part about this is it picks up after the secret unlockable ending from Peace Walker. However this one plot hole doesn't detract from the entire experience. The game is fluid, fast paced, and runs really smoothly. You don't have to have unlock the secret ending from Peace Walker to enjoy this game's story. The game's cutscenes and loading screens do a great job of explaining of what is going on.

When you first play this game you start off with the first mission Ground Zeroes. This is the prologue mission to Kojima's upcoming game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Ground Zeroes is best described as a taste of what is to come from the Phantom Pain. After you complete the Ground Zeroes main mission you will unlock five other missions which tell the story leading up to the main Ground Zeroes mission. These extra missions all take place on the same map as the main Ground Zeroes mission. You will be very familiar with the base after playing each one of these missions, however each mission is varied and interesting enough to keep you playing.

Also this game has a deep ranking system and it is fun to challenge yourself to get rank S on each misison, as well as completing the various challenges such as marking all the enemies or completing a mission without using a weapon. Challenges like this keep the replay value high.

This game is a perfect buy on sale otherwise I feel like there isn't enough content to justify the purchase. It is a love letter to Metal Gear Solid fans. This game does take place at a later place in the time line so it isn't the best place to jump in if you are new to the series and are attempting to get into the lore.

They partnered with NVIDIA which is a great step forward, if you're using Geforce Experience you can ""Optimize"" the game's visual settings with the program. They fixed generally awful keyboard controls *Looks at Dark Souls PTDE*, its still not the tightest controls on keybord though, for example removing/adding attachments to a rifle is done by holding ""1"" then pressing ""X"" or ""Y"" for each attatchment but could be simplified by ""X"" and ""C"" or any other set of keys. This game, like many other stealth games on PC doesn't have a wide range of walking animations for varying speeds specifically on Keyboard and mouse, but the game does support controllers and its present on there.

I'd also like to mention I've thrown in another 20 hours on my PS3, and that I'm running a i5 2500k and a GTX 770 (Gigabyte 2GB) and I'm getting FPS from around 45-60 depending on weather and weather I'm blowin' shit up or not.

13511125,76561198068974910,"[h1] METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES [/h1]

I'm quite biased towards the Metal Gear franchise, owning all of the games on their respective systems (except the ones on PC, I only have MGR and MGSV on PC only) and I can whole-heartedly recommend Ground Zeroes to a fan of the series. If you're like me and wish to 100% the game like you should on any Metal Gear game then this will easily drag out 20 hours out of you at the least and feel like mere minutes as they say [b] ''Time flies when you're having fun'' [/b]

[h1] SHAKING THE FORMULA [/h1]

I've played roughly 16 hours as of writing this review and I'm only 35% through the game and as a long time Metal Gear player, this game feels much more.. difficult (if you turn off Reflex Mode as soldiers no longer can manually radio in to alert HQ of your sighting) and has it's fair share of upgrades and downgrades.
The game feels much more organic and some things you'll do in this game will make you just think ''Wow, look how far we've come'', the gameplay itself can envoke feelings such as feelings of guilt, remorse and you'll be determined to do some actions and willing to ruin the run you're on by maybe murdering some of the soldiers on the base to carry out your actions. 

[h1] FOX ENGINE: IMPROVEMENTS AT A PRICE [/h1] 

The game is much more detailed than Metal Gear Solid 3 or 4 visually, but the problems in this game having a new engine merely is that there's clipping, a lot of it. In prior games after MGS1, soldiers, if knocked out near a wall where they'd usually clip would put their feet along the wall but in Ground Zeroes, their feet will rather clip. This could be an issue in the Fox Engine or maybe Ground Zeroes was rushed in the 2 years and 3 months since the reveal trailer back in September 2012. 

The game is very well optimised for a Metal Gear game on PC, if you've been following the series and played the PC port of MGS2, you would know how abbysmal that port was, requiring a gamepad or else the game is basically unplayable and all the issues in it. The keyboard and mouse controls feel well done enough, could have some improvements but all in all, is quite well done for Kojima Productions (or the porting team, not sure who did it) and leaves me quite optimistic for the future of Metal Gear returning back to PC.

[h1] IS THIS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR A NEW PLAYER? [/h1]

Dear god no, if you're one of those PC only players and this is your first Metal Gear, go rent/buy a PS3, buy Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection (it's got all the Metal Gear games except Ac!d, Ac!d 2, Portable Ops and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance) 

And play release order so you can play like all the other fans who had expectations and such and how their expectations were blown away or shocked.

[h1] HOW LONG IS THE MAIN STORY? [/h1]

From my first time playing on Normal, rescuing everyone bar one hidden prisoner, and getting caught about 5 times, 79 minutes.
My replay where I killed noone, rescued everyone bar one hidden prisoner and getting caught once, 69 minutes.
It's all how you play, remember, I'm only using the time the game gave me, and I'm not sure if that counts the cutscenes.

[h1] VERDICT [/h1]

I'm very biased for this and this is one of my top ten releases of the year 2014, I can't give a proper rating as it'd be quite unfair. 
 
I had a lot of fun even though some stuff were downgraded, but for $20/€20, it's really if you know you're gonna play it alot and not just one playthrough then never play again as for that price point, one playthrough is like throwing your money away.  

[spoiler] How the fuck am I meant to put my own music to play when the Helicopter flies to me? I want to listen to Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy so bad when the Helicopter arrives and it'd be lovely to have all the soldiers alerted because of that song while I bring 6-7 prisoners with me to leave.

See my hours, thats how long it takes to complete. Its not a bad demo, in fact its very solid if a bit overpriced as it is a 20$ demo without a sale. Its a single level that you beat once and unlock more sub missions to beat in that same level. I had heard that David Hayter had moved on to other things and was open to our new snake. Honestly, it was a bit distracting and I didn't think it would be.

If you go in expecting a full game or david hayter you will be disapointed. If however you play and see how well MGS works on this platform you will be pleasently impressed. New features like the spotting system are very solid and the combat is what I would expect from a super soldier. The graphics are rock solid as well and has a good frame rate on a midrange system. At times the AI is a bit stupid, I was able to take out 8 soldiers as they stupidly rushed the same choke point and ran into my waiting fist. This would not normally bother me but it would seem that kojima is trying to reinvent his brainchiled. So like any new game we need to be brutal.

I think it could have been better myself, polish the AI, don't charge folks for a demo and if you are going to replace a voice actor, do not change to one that sounds 100% diferent then the one used a few years ago, people will probably notice, I know I did.",1419199183,1419199183,1,0.52173912525177,172,139,1428717140,"{""recommendationid"": ""13508819"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198054015901"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 14, ""playtime_forever"": 172, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 139, ""last_played"": 1428717140}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""6.5/10\n\nSee my hours, thats how long it takes to complete.

13508796,76561198112147949,"Now that I've played quite a hefty amount of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, I feel that I'm in a very solid position to accuretly review this game without biase clouding my judgement. (TL;DR is included at the bottom of this review)

Right off the bat, this game is short content wise and that may turn off certain people, but trust me the replayability of all 7 missions is amazing. Each mission differs with objectives, but not area as the whole game takes place in a Cuban military base, but the level design of said base is astonishing. Every time you replay any of the missions it feels as if another route or way to execute said missions is found, creating a sense of longevity to the game that is hard to find in games. 

The main mission resorts around the finding and rescuing of two hostages and can easily be done in a speed run in 10 minutes. You might be saying at this time ""10 MINUTES!?!?! That doesn't justify a £16.00 price tag!"" But trust me, you won't me finishing the first mission within that time. Not even on your 2nd 3rd or 4th time. You'll start to quicky understand the many different ways of dealing with situations which the game throws at you. Suddenly you've spent 2-3 hours doing a mission that, if executed with extreme accuracy, can be done in under 10 minutes! This gives you a strong reason of replaying the main mission. Everytime you do, the game gives you a score. The highest score possible is a S-Rank which even I'm struggling to get 34.1 hours into the damn thing! 

The other 4 missions, labled as 'Pseudo-Historical Recreations' are centered on all sorts of different objectives from eliminating 2 targets to protecting a very 'special' undercover agent whilst shooting from a hellicopter. The last 2 'Deja Vu' and 'Jamais Vu' are obtained when all 9 XOF Patches are found within the game, this also creates another reason to go back and play the game because the 2 missions are filled with cameos and nostalgic moments that are pretty awesome.

You really need to play the game just to get a feel of how amazing the game mechanics are. It feels responsive and fast, with everything just feeling so damn satisfying! Like I said, it really needs to be seen first hand just to be respected!

With all that being said, the port is absolutley amazing! Running at a smooth 60FPS on high graphics settings, the game looks beautiful! The required graphical settings for all PC games are there in detail. You can really tell that Konami finally know how to make an almost perfect PC port and I'm excited to see how well they do Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain!

So, for a TL;DR,

PROS
- Amazing port with all of the settings you'd expect for a PC game. One of the best ports out there!
- Slick controls with amazing gameplay that is in a class of it's ow
- The replayability is astonishing with endless ways to execute all 7 different missions
- The graphics are absolutley breathtaking, running at 60FPS 1080P is incredible. And, if your rig can handle it, 4K with 60FPS. This game showcases what 'Next Gen' means!

CONS
- Some people may find the game somewhat short, with a lot more to be desired.

FINAL VERDICT... 9.5/10 
The great Kojima has made us PC player wait for this game, but the wait was worth every second! An absolutely brilliant port! Now we all have to patiently wait for MGS V: TPP, and I'm pretty sure that that's going to be three times as good as this!

13505843,76561197989724484,"Ground Zeroes is the latest in a long line of Metal Gear Solid titles, and I'm happy to say that the PC port of the console game is well-optimized and enjoyable. 

VISUALS: I've got an old Radeon HD 5770, and if I reduce the resolution to 1280x720, the game runs with all effects high at about 60FPS. Kojima Studios has worked some serious magic with this title. There is some pop-in with objects in the distance, but not enough to distract from the gameplay. Texture work is good, and the animations are fluid. 

GAMEPLAY: This is the meat of the game, right here. People criticize Ground Zeroes for being very short--a ""paid demo"" is the popular taunt against it. Honestly, the main mission can be completed in as few as ten minutes if you skip cutscenes and play with wild abandon. But that's up to you! How you approach a mission is very free-form. The Side Ops add another couple hours to the game. Most of the fun here is in finding new ways to satisfy goals. In one mission, for example, I walked through the level detonating anti-air defenses with C4. On the second play-through, I just stole a rocket launcher from a guard and took out all three in under a minute. 

Of course, this being a Metal Gear Solid title, you have the option to go through each level without killing anybody (mostly); you'll be rewarded for non-lethal playthroughs with new gadgets at your start point. The fun is in finding new ways to satisfy mission objectives.

STORY: Ha ha ha. Let's not even go there. You're Big Boss, invading a Cuban/American black site for I-don't-even-know-why, and doing lots of sneaky badassery along the way. It's Metal Gear. Don't think about the story, just enjoy the excuses it provides for you to do lots of interesting things. 

MUSIC/SOUND: Harry Gregson-Williams has consistently produced great tracks for Metal Gear Solid throughout the years, and his score here is just as good as his previous work. Use of licensed music, such as ""Here's to You"" is done skillfully. Sound design is great, all the character voices are cleanly rendered, the acting is mostly good (some overacting, but hey, it suits the story), and the audio for weapons and vehicles is accurate. Probably the one thing I have to say is that it's strange to play Big Boss and NOT hear David Hayter's voice come out! 

OVERALL: The main criticism leveled at this game has been its brevity. If you rush, you can beat it all in about three hours. If you take your time and enjoy the sandbox for what it is, you can play it for many hours more. This is a preamble for The Phantom Pain; I think we can safely say it's going to be good.

Now you may be asking on what makes this better than the versions available on the consoles?, well for one it now has 4K resolution and updated visuals, all of this makes the game much prettier, the gameplay is near enough exactly the same and the Mouse and Keyboard are just as easy to use, like a controller, I have played numerous amounts of hours (2 hours on PC and approximately 10 hours on Xbox One) and I can say for certain that this will please every Metal Gear Solid fan but will not please new players as much, the mission is very short and can be completed in just 5 minutes (That's if you speed run it without thinking about how MGS is played), if you are aiming to play the game the way it's meant to be played and then the mission can last you around about 2 hours and still leave you with something to do before you leave the mission.

The bonus missions that you get when you complete Ground Zeroes are fun to play, but are only different objectives on the same map, the only difference with the map is it's either Night or Day, with more or less enemies to fight.

The problems that I do have with the game is that a lot of the classic features were removed (And are to be added to The Phantom Pain), like, knocking on the wall and the iconic Cardboard Box, these were features that everyone used, they were a fun way to distract the guards and a fun little sneaking technique which will get a lot better and even more humorous than ever before.

My final verdict on Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is not a title that you can't live without however it is a title that you can't pass the opportunity to play, it's an experience that is unique to the Metal Gear franchise and is a worthy Sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a title that will leave it's mark on the Metal Gear franchise but will not scratch what Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater did for the franchise and the Stealth Genre.

13501583,76561198106977283,"First off, this game is essentially a prelude to MGSV: The Phantom Pain.

You may be inclined to call this a demo, and it's not entirely wrong, though if you didn't know this beforehand it's probably your own fault for not researching.

Gameplay:
It's great to play some Metal Gear again after so long. The AI is improved over past games and provides a good challenge even on Normal difficulty. Controls are a bit tough to master, much like past games, but once you get the hang of it you'll be sneaking and shooting like a pro. I play with a controller instead of keyboard + mouse, but other reviewers have said much about how good the K+M controls are.

With the side-ops and 'trials', GZ also offers good replay value. Typically one playthrough of a mission isn't enough to cover all the collectables and Easter eggs. Speaking of Easter eggs, the extra ops (Deja Vu and Jamais Vu) are full of these, meant to satisfy longtime Metal Gear fans.

Performance:
I play this game on my laptop, which has an Intel i3 processor, nVidia GT740M GPU and 4GB RAM. Below requirement, but the game runs real smooth with a combination of high and medium graphics settings. Graphics are really great; the Fox Engine is really something.

The AI is improved over past games and provides a good challenge even on Normal difficulty. Controls are a bit tough to master, much like past games, but once you get the hang of it you'll be sneaking and shooting like a pro. I play with a controller instead of keyboard + mouse, but other reviewers have said much about how good the K+M controls are.\n\nWith the side-ops and 'trials', GZ also offers good replay value. Typically one playthrough of a mission isn't enough to cover all the collectables and Easter eggs. Speaking of Easter eggs, the extra ops (Deja Vu and Jamais Vu) are full of these, meant to satisfy longtime Metal Gear fans.\n\nPerformance:\nI play this game on my laptop, which has an Intel i3 processor, nVidia GT740M GPU and 4GB RAM. Below requirement, but the game runs real smooth with a combination of high and medium graphics settings. Graphics are really great; the Fox Engine is really something.\n\ntl;dr: don't buy if you're looking for a 'full length game', but get it if you're a fan of Metal Gear."", ""timestamp_created"": 1419178484, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419178484, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 0, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": 0.5, ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

The game offers a lot more than the main storyline though, side ops are available & hell of a lot of fun. And they're all full of easter eggs for fans of MGS.

Pros*
-Outstanding graphics (one of the best looking engines I've seen to date)  
-great optimization (smooth framrate at all times for ultra settings on a mid-high end pc)
-imersive (its open world) 
-Lots of replay value (side missions and collectables) 
-deep gameplay (stealth options, guns blazing options, guards have many different reactions to behavior)
-well scripted story and cinematics (fans of the series will most likely want to know what happens after Peace Walker and new people might appreciate the way its presented)

Cons*
-short game (the main game is maybe about 2 hours, though this is intended to be a prologue for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain)
-small map (All gameplay takes place in on one prison base and its outer limits)
-Learning Curve (it may take getting used to, but its fun to experiment with different with all the different abilities) 
-Confusing story (if you're new to the series many of the character's motives won't make sense.  There is a background story available to read in the game.  Also, there are plot summaries available all over the internet.  The chronological story leading up to this point goes: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake eater, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, and Metal Gear Solid Peacewalker.

Your saved games will also be carried over to Phantom Pain which is its sequel and the main game of MGS V. \nAnd to the MGS team especially to Mr. Kojima, you did a great job here!

looking into this game before it hit steam you will of course know its a short game aimed at being a prequel to Phantom Pain as well as a way to give out a demo of Phantom Pain to new players! 

Kiefer Sutherland is now the voice of Snake alough snake don't talk much in this game at all, but i am sure he will talk more in Phantom Pain.

The game has so much replay-ability for you to enjoy going back to collect things you missed, bumping up the difficulty or playing a different style!

13490764,76561198098137326,"I've played every canon Metal Gear game to date, but the short few hours I've spent with Ground Zeroes may just be the best I've had with the entire franchise. Prior to its release, the prologue for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain came under fire for being ""too short"" and essentially being a twenty dollar demo. My opinion is a sentiment that many others share, but I want to make it very clear: [b]Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes has more than enough content to justify its price tag.[/b]

Ground Zeroes offers a contained albeit highly detailed stealth sandbox tech demo with plenty of ways to complete your objectives. As for the main objectives, going back and doing them now would probably take me a solid twenty or thirty minutes or so. One speedrunner managed to S rank the main mission in under four. That's only if you know what you're doing, though. For my first run, I had to creep around the facility slowly and carefully as I gathered intel and familiarised myself with the game's surroundings. I clocked in at the end of the first mission at around four hours or so. Rather than give you a comprehensive list of the game's myriad of mechanics, I'll give a more general overview and a personal account of how I tackled the ""Ground Zeroes"" mission.

The game's objectives are extremely simple. Find the target(s) and extract them to the LZ of your choosing. Everything else is up to you. I decided to explore the camp at my leisure, taking out as few guards as possible (and doing so non-lethally, as a self-imposed challenge). In one section of the camp, I found and rescued a prisoner, who gave me the location of a ventilation shaft in return. When I reached the main objective, a POW I was to extract - he was amongst several others. Of my own volition, I decide to free each of them methodically, running them back to the rendezvous one at a time (with the instrumental version of ""Heavens Divide"" playing on my Walkman, of course) before finally extracting the target. Needless to say, throwing them all in the chopper one by one as bullets whizzed around us was incredibly exciting, and it was a moment that I created on my own.

Aside from the opening and closing cutscenes (neither of which are terribly long, at least by Metal Gear standards), there's very little direction or hand holding for the player, aside from a few audio tips and basic tutorial prompts. The first objective however, isn't too difficult to reach and won't take too much time if tackled directly, provided you play in a patient mindset, and don't go in Darksydephil style. For the second half of the mission, the player is tasked with finding another POW, location unknown. Rather than point you directly to them like most games, you're supposed to listen to an audio tape (which can thankfully be rewound and fast forwarded) to gain clues as to their whereabouts.

Using my prior knowledge of the camp, I figured their general location, and used the hidden passage I discovered earlier thanks to the prisoner I saved. Once inside, I was spotted. Low on options and refusing to kill anyone, I rushed into the camp and hid. Of course, hiding for a few minutes isn't enough to make the enemies in Ground Zeroes forget about your existence. I was forced to creep around the base, carefully avoiding the alerted patrols and knocking out anyone in my way as I descended into the compound. Once I reached my objective however, it was probably the most satisfying moment I've experienced as a player in recent memory, just for the sheer amount of freedom I was given to accomplish my task.

From there, it was a mad dash to the next LZ, after which I was treated to a lengthy cutscene, ending the title with some extremely visceral scenes and crazy twists, in usual Metal Gear fashion. After finishing the game and listening to the obligatory post-credits conversation, I was brought back to this title screen.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359502553

Sure, I was able to beat the main mission in under four hours, but completion of the main attraction didn't even account for a tenth of the game's content. With multiple collectibles, audio tapes, Easter eggs and other secrets to uncover, and several other side missions in addition to the main story, Ground Zeroes is definitely content-rich enough to justify paying twenty dollars, especially when it looks so stunning and plays so smooth.

For Metal Gear fans, this is a bold new direction for the series, with plenty for hardcore fans to love. Many of the series' quirks have been ironed out whilst retaining the tactical espionage action gameplay we all love so much. Crouching, crawling, diving, CQC and other manoeuvres are easier to pull of and far more satisfying as well, whilst combat itself is still kinda clunky, in a good way. Be assured, this is a stealth game. Going in gun blazing will be met with heavy resistance, and more often than not, you'll find yourself starting over every time you see that familiar '!'.

Newcomers needn't worry, though. If you consider yourself a fan of Deus Ex or even Far Cry, you'll have no trouble adjusting to the latest instalment of the OG stealth series. The story is much sparser compared to earlier titles, continuing the trend of giving the player more freedom and letting the game's mechanics take precedence that started in Peace Walker.

Yes, it's short, but it was advertised as a prologue. It has the main mission along with side missions, two if them being fun extra ops missions. One feautures Snake and another features Raiden from Metal Gear Rising. 

Gameplay. The shooting system is perfect for a stealth/shooter hybrid. You can go in stealthy or go in guns blazing. The stealth system has no percentage on the corner of your screen anymore. You just use your thinking about whether the enemy can spot you there, and judge it from there. No more hands helping you out. The only thing helping you out would be the reflex mode which can be turned off. Reflex mode is a new feature introduced in MGSV that slows down time so you can react and shoot a guard and either kill or tranqualize him before an alert is triggered.

Quality. The quality is as MGS as it can get. Always superb as usual with the new story telling design Kojima is trying to push. The graphics are sharp and great which makes you want to just look around the environment and forget your objective.

Story. It continues off from where peacewalker left us. I wont spoil it but it's a cliffhanger that will lead up to The Phantom Pain which should release on 2015.

Controls. I myself use my dualshock 4 to play on the PC so I'm not really sure how they are on KB/M. But I'm sure it's pretty challenging since the DS4 can barely use all the buttons to map the controls. But they did a job well done.

For a price of $13.49 this was a steal. The replayability to unlock all items, S rank the missions, and even unlock some secret costumes keeps an MGS fan going for that 100% on the bottom left. I give this game a 9/10 and would have to say it's one of the best games I have played this year and recommend it to every MGS fan and newcomer to the series.

My biggest complaint with this game (and most peoples complaint) is that the game is incredibly short. But it is reduced to $20, and I would recommend that you wait to pick it up on sale for around $10. But with that aside the game is pretty good. 

The game looks amazing on system (gtx 770 and i-3570k @4.2ghz), I can play at everything on high and a constant 60fps. So yes the game is an amazing port, probably the best that I know of. The combat in my opinion is fun and addicting. I don't know why but it is so satisfying to shoot an enemy in this game and then hear them drop. And the story, well the story I didn't fully understand. But then again this is my first MGS game. 

Overall I would give this game a 8/10. THe @20 asking price is more reasonable than the 30$ on launch for the consoles. But for the hours I did play this game they were enjoyable.

I'll get straight to the point. This review's main goal is to address common misconceptions.

Amount of Content:
Ground Zeroes offers 7 missions: one main story, four side missions with different objectives, two extra side missions that are aimed at the fans of the series. Each mission has two difficulty settings (hard unlocks after beating normal), secret collectibles/objectives and unlockable trials (challenges). Throughout all missions you'll be dealing with only one location: Camp Omega, which is a fairly large facility. Each mission has it's own time of day.
If you like playing your games at a medium pace and you never had contact with this game before then you'll be able to complete all 7 missions in 5-10 hours+. If you're willing to spend time to get 100% completion, get most of the rewards and read/listen to the story then you might end up with 15-20 hours+ on you. However, it's possible to speedrun all 7 mission in ~1 hour (that is, if you know what you're doing). If you buy Phantom Pain alone then you won't be able to access Camp Omega and it's missions through it as they're avilable only for those that purchased Ground Zeroes (meaning this is a prologue and not a demo). However, if you purchased both then you'll be able to visit Camp Omega with all your Phantom Pain upgrades, not to mention special bonuses.

Performance & Settings:
Runs on systems that are below minimum system requirements. Well optimized, but could've had even higher level of detail / drawing distance settings (some visible popup of small items). One common complaint are increased amounts of depth of field (blur / out of focus). It's easily ""fixed"" by decreasing Screen Filtering to High.
Fully playable on K&M but could've had a slightly better control scheme (currently there's some sensitivty bug when aiming while zoomed). Minority of people experiences some compatibility issues some of which were caused by bad system configurations, but some are legit and there most likely will be a compatibility fixing patch.


Metal Gear is a legendary franchise, Ground Zeroes gives you a tiny bite of Phantom Pain and from here it only gets better.

Not only is the quality of the game of a very high standard but the technical execution is top-notch that puts other developers to shame in this market. I am a massive Metal Gear Solid fan and I hold the utmost respect for Hideo Kojima and his Konami team who have delivered once again; a breathtaking title with huge care and attention. Their loyalty to fans is admirable in what has been a very difficult year for gamers and gaming as a whole. 

The ambition Konami have and their passion for games make this prologue a great purchase and a welcome warm-up for The Phantom Pain. Some may argue that this is a glorified demo but there is enough content here to guarantee hours of play and substantial replay value. The main portion of the game is a single mission with a simple objective; rescue two hostages from a military base. Other missions within the same base called 'Side Ops' can be unlocked which add plentiful more hours to the game. Completing the main mission and additional operations can unlock extra missions, equipment and collectables. Also you'll be eager to improve your completion times and mission grade based on performance. Although the military base is central to the whole game; it is massive and offers many ways to complete the tasks on offer. The objectives are varied and even the night/day missions add a whole new dimension which keeps the game fresh.

There are a few remnants of it being a port of a console game that annoy me.  There are instructions with references to controller buttons.  At one point, when a helicopter took off, an Xbox One controller that happened to be hooked up to my PC just started to vibrate though I had been using the mouse and keyboard the whole time.

There are allot of cut scenes and at first I thought the game would never start.

So. Looking beyond those small issues, this is a game that I will add to my play again list.  I like the game play and mechanics.  I didn't feel that the play suffered due to the few issues I had, and, though I have only played through the base mission twice, I am looking forward to discovering what else the side and extra missions have to offer.

Good game.

13480527,76561198006697626,"We'll start off with what's obvious from the get-go: This is a drop dead gorgeous game. It's beautiful. There are some really neat lighting effects and water looks great. Solid textures and some nice depth of field effects as well. It also runs terrifically on my setup. It's probably the single best PC port I've played since Splinter Cell Blacklist. It's a refreshing change in an industry that's given us duds like Assassin's Creed Unity that are hardly playable at high settings even on a strong setup like mine.

That being said, I have a number of complaints about the game. I finished in 4 hours. It's absurdly short, more a demo than anything.

In a lot of ways this franchise hasn't changed much since the second game, which is admittedly fine in some areas. I consider myself a longtime fan of the franchise -- Metal Gear Solid is probably one of my single favorite games of all-time. Fans of the series love the exclamation points, the cardboard boxes, and the weird, preachy stories. I'm no different. I love all that stuff, I eat it up. And it's important that the series doesn't lose its identity for the sake of progress. But there are some features of the series in this game that just plain haven't aged well, and that's where most of my complaints come from.

My biggest issue with the game comes from the foolish way checkpointing is laid out. Imagine you carefully and meticulously move halfway across an open yard of tents, taking care not to be spotted, only to slip up near the end due to hitting the wrong button. Now your last checkpoint forces to restart a football field (about 100 meters for our European friends) away and retrace your own steps. You also get to hear the same introductory codec message every single time, too. Not good.

Checkpointing is a holdover from older games that really does a lot to damage the experience here. There's no reason a semi-open world stealth title shouldn't have a save anywhere feature. Hell, the option to save via a codec message isn't even present in this game, so why even have checkpoints at all? It doesn't make sense to use them over a manual save function. This isn't even a question of save scumming, it's just a matter of modern convenience that Konami seems to have forgotten. I have the same issue with the Far Cry series. It's 2014. There's no excuse for these games to use checkpointing when they'd be far better served by utilizing a dynamic save system. Bad checkpoints are some of the most frustrating things in gaming, and it puzzles me that developers still use them when there are obviously better systems available. Seriously, checkpoints are down there with escort missions. Game developers: Kill them immediately. Please. I despise them in games, especially in stealth games.

I had some serious issues with the camera as well. There are times when you've got a roof or some kind of structure far over your head, and the camera needlessly zooms straight into the back of Big Boss's head. Why? It's nowhere near the ceiling. It doesn't work well with cover, either. It was frequently a pain to me when I would be creeping between small spaces, such a between cargo boxes or tents. I'd stop at a corner, move up into cover, and try to get a peek around the corner to see if a soldier was there. And more often than not, the camera would refuse to comply, just sitting closely behind Boss's head. They obviously knew that this was an issue because they included a shoulder switching camera mechanic, which rarely seems to do much. I was detected a few times simply because I was frustrated with the camera and decided I was sick of fooling with it, so I moved out. It's ridiculous to me that the camera is an issue in a game these days. I can't remember the last time I even had camera issues in a game at all. A poorly controlled camera is an issue that belongs 20 years ago in the N64 era. Not in a modern, next generation game. It's inexcusable.

Another holdover from the old games that seriously bothered me was the control scheme. There are menus within menus within menus when you've got a guard grabbed or when you want to customize weapons. You're holding a bumper, or flicking a stick, or pressing some random arbitrary button that just doesn't feel natural. The worst part about these menus is that there frequently is just no need for them. Games like Blacklist have featured the same types of things but made them vastly more simplified and intuitive. I find myself having to check the controls screen multiple times per session because I can't remember how to do something. That's a sign of having an unintuitive, overly complex, poorly designed control scheme. Movement, furthermore, is hampered by having a weird crawl/crouch/stand system, including a weird button to dive to the ground, which I didn't really understand or ever feel any need to use. Then there are a bunch more controls for when you're crawling. You can roll to the left. You can roll to the right. Hold a button to crawl more quickly. It's all just needlessly complex, and it feels tacked on when it's not really necessary.

There's no free climbing in this game like there is in other stealth games of the past few years -- And I'm not saying that it needs it. But movement in open-world or semi-open world stealth games like Blacklist, Dishonored, or Assassin's Creed, for example, has way more dimensions than it does in Ground Zeroes due to the distinct verticality in the form of climbing (or blinking, in Dishonored's case) up to platforms or roofs. It's nearly always present no matter where you are, and you know so intrinsically how to accomplish it that you don't have to think about it. Dishonored teaches you to blink once, and you've got it down. Assassin's Creed teaches you to free run once, and you remember. In Ground Zeroes, you can only really move up or down when there's a ladder present. Otherwise, you're moving simply on the ground, back and forth, to and fro. It doesn't have the verticality of those games. So why are the controls so damned complex and involved? It's how it's always been in the series, but with the advent of newer games with great traversal systems, Ground Zeroes' controls feature so many aspects that just seem totally unnecessary, and it only serves to muck everything up. I can't help but feel a simpler approach would have been far more successful here. Having an intuitive understanding of movement and being able to act without thinking is absolutely paramount in stealth games where being seen can lead to a very quick death, and I never feel like I have that down when I play this game. It's something that would come with practice, sure, but why should I have to practice at something that I can intrinsically pick up and do in pretty much every other game in the genre?

Look, I don't want Metal Gear to become Splinter Cell. I'm not saying that at all. But the step forward that Guns of the Patriots made in 2008 was excellent, and it breathed new life into the gameplay of the series and really saved it from becoming too dated. Gunplay was far better in that game. It was always wonky and unintuitive in the older games, with its weird go-to-first-person-and-then-aim thing. It never felt natural. You always felt like a bumbling idiot when you were trying to shoot somebody, and Solid Snake was supposed to be an expert with a firearm. Guns of the Patriots completely fixed that. They updated their gunplay to a more modern, third person shooter type system, and it worked fantastically. That is the type of step Konami needs to take with things like movement and checkpointing. Ground Zeroes, unfortunately, doesn't take that step. It just feels like a way prettier Guns of the Patriots. Which is certainly not a bad thing, and don't get me wrong: This is not a terrible game.

If you're a Metal Gear fan, buy it. You'll like it. But if you're just looking for a stealth experience, I'd heartily recommend Splinter Cell Blacklist over this game.",1419106409,1419113740,0,0.543079137802124,232,232,1419113577,"{""recommendationid"": ""13480527"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198006697626"", ""num_games_owned"": 463, ""num_reviews"": 105, ""playtime_forever"": 232, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 232, ""last_played"": 1419113577}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""We'll start off with what's obvious from the get-go: This is a drop dead gorgeous game.

But movement in open-world or semi-open world stealth games like Blacklist, Dishonored, or Assassin's Creed, for example, has way more dimensions than it does in Ground Zeroes due to the distinct verticality in the form of climbing (or blinking, in Dishonored's case) up to platforms or roofs. It's nearly always present no matter where you are, and you know so intrinsically how to accomplish it that you don't have to think about it. Dishonored teaches you to blink once, and you've got it down. Assassin's Creed teaches you to free run once, and you remember. In Ground Zeroes, you can only really move up or down when there's a ladder present. Otherwise, you're moving simply on the ground, back and forth, to and fro. It doesn't have the verticality of those games. So why are the controls so damned complex and involved? It's how it's always been in the series, but with the advent of newer games with great traversal systems, Ground Zeroes' controls feature so many aspects that just seem totally unnecessary, and it only serves to muck everything up. I can't help but feel a simpler approach would have been far more successful here. Having an intuitive understanding of movement and being able to act without thinking is absolutely paramount in stealth games where being seen can lead to a very quick death, and I never feel like I have that down when I play this game. It's something that would come with practice, sure, but why should I have to practice at something that I can intrinsically pick up and do in pretty much every other game in the genre?\n\nLook, I don't want Metal Gear to become Splinter Cell. I'm not saying that at all. But the step forward that Guns of the Patriots made in 2008 was excellent, and it breathed new life into the gameplay of the series and really saved it from becoming too dated. Gunplay was far better in that game. It was always wonky and unintuitive in the older games, with its weird go-to-first-person-and-then-aim thing. It never felt natural. You always felt like a bumbling idiot when you were trying to shoot somebody, and Solid Snake was supposed to be an expert with a firearm. Guns of the Patriots completely fixed that. They updated their gunplay to a more modern, third person shooter type system, and it worked fantastically. That is the type of step Konami needs to take with things like movement and checkpointing. Ground Zeroes, unfortunately, doesn't take that step. It just feels like a way prettier Guns of the Patriots. Which is certainly not a bad thing, and don't get me wrong: This is not a terrible game.\n\nIf you're a Metal Gear fan, buy it. You'll like it.

13480175,76561197983662248,"To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.

Gameplay: Oh boy, the at one time ""$40 demo"" has found its way to Steam. Of course, this game isn't any different from the versions that were launched prior to this. This was actually my first time playing it, as I don't own an Xbox One or a PS4, so I was able to get in on it after the rage train had all but subsided. Now, I've had a bit of a history with stealth games, and they've not always been the best. I'm *really* bad at stealth. Like, really bad. I found Metal Gear Solid 1 to be a much more difficult and frustrating gaming experience on Normal than Ninja Gaiden Black was on Hard mode. I've matured about six years since then; I'm still rubbish at the genre, but I can more easily appreciate what's going on here in this game, and if this is the direction that Metal Gear Solid V is taking, I'm all the more excited because of it.

The Metal Gear Solid franchise (at least for 1-3) have always felt like a pseudo-non-linear kind of game. Stage design has been historically fairly linear, at least if my memory from six years ago hasn't failed me. Here in Ground Zeroes, the game is much more open-ended as far as the way to get to the objective goes, and it benefits from it all the more. Stealth, in my eyes, has always been about player creativity, and there's LOADS of room to get creative here, all while keeping the world feeling very organic and natural-feeling. There may be a conveniently placed storm drain for you to crawl through an otherwise very tricky area, but it makes sense for it to be there. Likewise, there may be a lot of concrete dividers all over the place, but it doesn't ever feel like they're put there just so that you can sneak around the area. All in all, the stage design is pretty darn fantastic with this game, and I am absolutely excited to see the huge sprawling world Kojima has planned for Phantom Pain.

Enemy AI seems to be a lot better this time around as well, if a bit slow on the uptake at times. While I can't say this for certain, it does seem like they've eschewed the ""cone of vision"" AI that has plagued the series for so long. They're pretty decent at tracking you down if they see you as well, but it never gets to the point where it feels unfair. I do kinda wish that when you rescue a certain character that was in a delusional state, the character's delusional ramblings caught the attention of the guards. I think that would've added a hell of a lot more tension to the game experience, but this is somewhat a minor complaint. The gunplay is good, but I hardly ever used it, as when I play a stealth game I try my best to go for zero casualties. 

Of course, the big factor on whether you decide to play this or not comes down to the cost per hour of gameplay. According to completionists, you can get about 6-8 hours out of this game if you go for 100% completion, but if you're just playing it for the main mission, you'll only get about an hour to an hour and a half out of it. Even being as bad at stealth as I am, it only took me 80 minutes. It was a damned good 80 minutes, but it was still 80 minutes. 9/10.

Story: I'm by no means an expert on the overall story of the Metal Gear games, so I'll just approach the game's story from what was presented. It's uh... something, all right. Again, the story does suffer a bit from the fact that the game is only ~80 minutes long, but it does a lot with that 80 minutes. Even though the character intros are brief and details as to these character's lives are vague at best (at least from an outsider's perspective), they do a really good job of fitting the scenarios realistically. Also, the cutscene at the end gets pretty darn grisly; a much unexpected turn from the usually (not always intentionally) silly standard of writing for the series. Kaz's has a silly line which you've no doubt heard by now, but apart from that, everything just worked and it just worked really well. Very enjoyable. 9/10.

Graphics: Metal Gear Rising impressed me with how good of a port it was to the PC, and Ground Zeroes absolutely blows my mind with how good of a port it is. You've got a good bit of graphical fidelity options (no Anti-aliasing options directly though, which I found rather weird), and Fox Engine is damn well optimized for PC. Steam lists the recommended GPU as a GTX 760 (which I've got) and I was able to run everything on Extra High settings at 1080p 60FPS with only a few frame dips here and there. It's stuff you've gotta really be watching for, though, and if you're not of the hawk-eyed variety, you may not even notice it at all. It does punish my GPU a bit though, causing temps to hover at around 65-70degC, but for a game that looks THIS amazing, I can't complain one bit. There are a few off textures here and there which may just have been me running out of VRAM or something, but it's once again stuff you've gotta be actively looking for. Impeccable. Simply impeccable. 5/5.

Sound: A lot of people got mad about Kiefer Sutherland replacing David Hayter as the voice actor in this game, and I've gotta be honest; I think Kiefer does a lot better job. He does a good job at coming across as a warrior who still has some empathy somewhere within his bullet-riddled heart. In fact, the only one who has kind of a not-so-great vocal performance was Kaz, but that may just be because of fiddle-related reasons. The OST is damned good as well. Then again, I suppose the Metal Gear Solid games have always had good OSTs, so this is something of a moot point. Sound design is great as well, with loads of minor details serving to both help you get through the game and enhance the immersion. Excellent stuff. 5/5.

Overall scores are: 9/9/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. If Phantom Pain can keep this level of quality throughout the entire game, it may very well be Game of the Decade.

13478874,76561197974813550,"[h1]Great appetizer! - 8/10[/h1]

[b]Introduction:[/b]
All MGS and stealth action lovers are patiently waiting for 'The Phantom Pain' and now all PC gamer can finally get their hands on the prologue too to dawdle away. It was about time! As stated - it's only a short prologue, but it's well produced and will give you a brief look, what you can expect from the upcoming full price title. I won't start to talk about the story or objective this time, because it's only one area and one story mission and you wouldn't discover anything on your own anymore. Please check the pro and contra list and the conclusion to make sure, if it could be worth your money or not.


[b]Pro:[/b]
[list][*]it's a Metal Gear Solid!
[*]interesting story
[*]very good stealth action
[*]great port (enjoyable mouse+keyboard or controller navigation, no stupid 30 FPS lock, adjustable graphic settings)
[*]very well optimized performance
[*]great graphics
[*]great cinematics
[*]great voice actors
[*]great soundtrack
[*]ridable vehicles
[*]some replay value thanks to different side missions and collectable stuff
[*]no crashes (for me)[/list]


[b]Contra:[/b]
[list][*]very short story mission (only 50-90 minutes depending on playstyle)
[*]price tag (19,99 Euro) is too high for the delivered content  [the 13,39 Euro sale price tag is much more appropriate]
[*]some knocked out or sleeping enemies can be displayed as standing for a moment from time to time, when you're reentering a certain area and then they will fall back to the ground
[*]some knocked out or sleeping enemies can magically disappear and reappear (only happened once for me)
[*]you can't drag people while crawling
[*]ugly subtitle font[/list]


[b]Conclusion:[/b]
'Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes' is nothing more than a short appetizer for the upcoming 'The Phantom Pain', but it's a very good one for every MGS fan. It will satisfy your desire for the moment and make you hungry for more at the same time...I'm still not sure, if that's a good or a bad thing. This prologue is a must-have for every fan, but it's absolutely nothing for people, who haven't played a MGS before and/or have no clue about what the heck 'The Phantom Pain' is due to the minor content. And don't be afraid of (another) awful port, it's really well done and optimized.

Cons: Story lasts one mission then basically tells you to go buy the Phantom Pain when it comes out (although there are some additional side missions you can play), game locks at 60 fps which I don't see as that bad of a problem since most people will be playing on 60hz monitors anyways.

With all that being said this is not a ""FULL"" game. This is a glorified tech-demo/prologue to the up-coming MGSV:Phantom Pain. This by all means isn't something that will keep you busy for 30+ hours. Not saying it won't keep you for awhile if you're into 100% completions like I am with this series. 

There is plenty to do if you're a die-hard MGS fan. So I'm only going suggest this game to fans of the series. If however you have an extra 13-20 dollars laying around and like the idea of a free-roam (in a smaller space) stealth/action with a decent starting point for a story then by all means BUY IT. Also if you plan on buying Phantom Pain, you will need to play this game to get the full scope of whats going on. 

Story: 9/10 (so far so good on Hideos part and looking good on the set-up to phantom pain, which will most likely being another amazing emotional ride)

Graphics/Visuals: 10/10 (some of the best looking lighting you will see in a game, aslong as you have a nice GPU/CPU combo you will be in for a visual treat un-matched by 99% of gaming has to offer.)

Gameplay: 9/10 (very rarely there are camera problems where it seems like the camera is too close and hindering your view, works great on a xbox 360 controller aswell as mouse/keyboard)

PC Optimization: 9/10 (lots of options and customization to get the most out of your hardware. Would like to see a better option for depth of field which I've found out turning it to ""Low"" stops the blur effects and makes the game look better. I don't know why turning an option down makes the game look better, but it does)

Overall: 9.5/10 Amazing game with very few to no flaws. Short maybe 10-20 hours of gameplay, longer only if you want to complete everything. Reports state that Phantom Pain will have over 200 hours of gameplay. So its fine with me if this one is short if PP is going to be insanly long and complex.

TL:DR: Buy this game if you are a MGS Fan boy or Want a short but sweet stealth/action thriller with a great story set-up to Phantom Pain. 

PS: Game Devs... stop using Depth of Field and Motion Blur it's a cheap tactic to make plebs think something looks great but really doesn't. I know this feature was probably added for low-tier hardware (consoles) to make it look good even on low settings.

I found Ground Zeroes on the PS3 suffered from the same problem GTAV did, low framerate! After playing the silky smooth MGS4 I expected FoxEngine to be a step forward. Instead what I got was a chuggy, blurry, and jaggy mess. Once I beat the main mission I took the disk out and never wanted to try it again.

Fast forward to the PC re-release and I was getting nervous. My computer is a few years old now, a Phenom II x4 965be and a GTX570. I was worried I would be getting a similar experience with low framerates, jaggy  models, blurry textures. Even if it didn't run I was still going to be buying it to show support for Godjima, and all Japanese developers for that matter, to encourage future PC releases.

Well hot damn, does it run amazing. I'm running on High settings at 1920x1080 and the game went from being the uglyest MGS I've played to the most georgus. It runs silky smooth, the animations are great, the textures are detailed.... It's just damn beautiful.

As for the content I've put in 13 hours so far and am only at 18% unlocked, and that was from the main mission and two side missions on normal difficulty and B rank. If you were to JUST play the main mission the game can be short, like an hour the first time short, but you would be missing out. The side missions have enough variety in weather, spawns, items, costumes, and objecteves to keep things fresh and exciting well after the main course. I have many more hours to go as I finish each unique mission, S ranking them all, then doing it all over again on Hard.

Considering it's reputation as ""a demo with little content"" this would be one of the best PC games I've ever bought.

As the prelude to MGSV:The Phantom Pain, it serves as an introductory course into the games mechanics and storyline.  With backstory and context provided in a Graphic Novel style, you are able to learn of the events that lead up to the story of Ground Zeroes.

13473134,76561198044372725,"Runs brilliantly at 1080p on an older 3770k-OC (4.2Ghz)/ 660ti-OC SLI based rig, Full 60FPS with a rare judder on some transitions in cutscenes / to gameplay. Only noticed bad pop-in once, though any enemies over a certain distance won't be drawn until you zoom in on them. All settings maxed except for Shadows on High, which didn't actually seem to be the problem in the end, but I couldn't be bothered to change them back.

Graphical options could be a little better, too many things are bundled under special effects and the like, so you can't disable just DoF or anything like that, but everything else from resolution to shadows and lighting is controllable. 

Importantly the 30FPS limit is by default disabled, though it might be worth enabling on weaker machines, since gameplay is slow enough that looking better may be worth the sacrifice of responsiveness / smoothness.

Looks great, controls are good except for no mouse control in the menus (Otherwise all keys seem to be rebindable). Gameplay feels good though I've not really played the older games. If I have a complaint it's that enemies can respawn too easily, if you clear a route then return to take something with you, the further enemis are likely to have respawned.

Haven't done the extra side-missions, but the main mission is enjoyable, though short. Finishing it left me with a percentage of 7%, so theres definitely some time-killing stuff to do as well as the optional extra missions.

For £11.38, It's worth it for sure. Would not have been happy to have paid £40+ on the consoles, but I'm looking forward to the main game after playing this.

13472387,76561198010506245,"First of all, yes, it's not a particularly long game. Ground Zeroes consists of one main story mission, four missions that tie into the story, and two non-canon missions, all on the same map but set at different times of day with different atmospheric conditions and weather. You could probably experience every mission in around five to six hours, but the beauty of Ground Zeroes is in the replay value.

A total revamp of the controls and systems of Metal Gear Solid, Ground Zeroes takes a common sense approach to stealth and infiltration. Most stealth games have very arbitrary rules that are sometimes quite obtuse and don't always seem to be based in reality, but rather game logic. In Ground Zeroes, if you hide somewhere you would likely hide in real life, you will remain hidden. Guards no longer have cones of vision that spot you as soon as you're on the fringes of them, allowing you to either be spotted from a distance, or hide in the corners of their peripheral vision, depending entirely on your coverage, if you're in shadow, or what kind of movements you're making.

The controls are fluid, and the animations are smooth and quick. It plays like an absolute dream. Despite being a cross-gen title, Ground Zeroes still looks impressive and has a very clean look and natural balance of colours that few other games have. Despite some problems with those using AMD cards (driver related), Ground Zeroes is a great port that runs on a wide variety of systems, and eliminates the problem of poor level of detail managing at a distance the console versions had.

It's not a perfect port (the anti-aliasing leaves something to be desired, and the DOF effect doesn't seem correctly implemented in gameplay), or a perfect game (it's not particularly long if you're only wanting the main story), but I would say it is worth trying out. You might just end up liking it, and finding yourself getting many more hours out of replaying the game than you thought you would.

Port-wise it's really... Erm.. Solid. 
Tons of graphical options like:

- Custom resolution (Supports 4K)
- Shadows
- Lighting
- SSAO
- etc.

The only downside is that the DOF is combined with AA.
It plays well with a controller and M+K (M+K controls are rebindable!)
Overall, The new FOX engine looks beautiful and runs great on PC!

13470532,76561198029290788,"[h1]After years of deception, Metal Gear Solid series finally uncloaks before us PC Gamers. But how does the game perform?[/h1]

MGS: GZ is designed to be more of a prequel to the true next installment of the series: Phantom Pain (don't worry, that game is also coming to PC). This particular game was made just to quench our thirsts and make the waiting a bit easier. More importantly, because of the dramatic shift the game takes the series by introducing open world and very open-ended gameplay, it was a way for fans of the past installments to familiarize with the new structure of the game.  

Now I've seen many people claim this to be a glorified paid demo---I completely disagree however. The game offers a lot of side content, replayability with different approach to justify your purchase. 

If you decide to just breeze through the main mission without bothering anything else, it would take only about 2 hours to finish it. However, if you plan to investigate the entire camp, find intel, rescue POWs, gather collectibles and do some of the side missions, then it will take you around 10 hours at least. This sort of venturing out of your way and exploring is definitely new to the series, which fundamentally breaks the linear level design and objectives of the previous games and works remarkably well. The open world provides more tactical approaches in handling the missions:  provides more ways of infiltrating mission area and approaching objectives. However at the same time the open ended nature can work against you as enemies are more spread out, are generally a lot smarter and if they see you then you are in for a tough firefight --- In previous games, this often led to many players restarting to the last checkpoint as more than often once you were spotted, it was impossible to go hidden again and you would eventually die. This time, you have the flexibility to not engage in the firefight for long and quickly become a ghost again. Another important thing to note is that the enemy AI is very dynamic--- They don’t follow specific patrol patterns for long and if you ‘disrupt’ their patrol, they will react in unpredictable ways. So, less memorization and more reaction is the gameplay paradigm that is enforced into the design and I for one gladly welcome this change.

So how is the PC port? One word ---Solid (no pun intended). The game runs beautifully across a wide range of systems and looks pretty good as well. While there are odd low resolution textures and detail here and there, but I guess that is what happens when you make a cross console-generation game (also available on the PS3 and Xbox 360) but it hardly detracts from the overall visual experience. My only issue with the game’s graphics is the obsessive use of blur. At times I feel like the game uses blur in the wrong situations and not in the right amount. For example when you point the gun in first person, it for some reason blurs the crosshair. The game also have some problems finding the right intensity of the blur for the relative distance to the background. Also, the FXAA used is poorly implemented and it just looks like it blurs out a lot of textures in hopes of reducing jaggies. For consoles I understand as FXAA is cost efficient in GPU power, but for PC, please give us an option to turn it off and use some other form of AA that does not blur the image. Even if some other AA was not an option, I would gladly turn off the AA here and instead using DSR (down sampling) to render the game at a higher resolution and downsize it, which works better than any AA out there anyways. 

The controls of the previous games in the series always felt like one of the weakest areas, simply put--- they weren’t designed to be effective when you needed urgency in your movements and combat. Thankfully, the controls of this game is very well designed. While many would understandably want to play this game using a controller, I decided to try it with the mouse and keyboard as it was a PC Gamer thing to do! After playing for a few minutes, I changed some of the controls to better suit my needs: Making the most of the extra buttons on my Logitech G502 mouse, I mapped many of the controls to my mouse as I feel I am much faster using the mouse buttons than many of the keyboard buttons. Again, this is down to the preference of the player which will vary from person to person. It was a bit odd to find out that the extra mouse buttons other than the right and left click not bindable. Another thing to note, the game does not alternative buttons for each command. Also oddly enough, the menu navigation cannot be done with the mouse, instead the keyboard WASD is used and 1 and 3 to change the menu options which I find it weird. These rough edges shows Konami’s inexperience with PC game design but they can be easily solved in a future update. 

So that pretty much covers it. This is a small, yet delicious, slice of game that I have been waiting anxiously for. Like every delicious slice, it just makes you want more!",1419076755,1420187556,1,0.6196513772010803,1631,766,1441122144,"{""recommendationid"": ""13470532"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561198029290788"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 126, ""playtime_forever"": 1631, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 766, ""last_played"": 1441122144}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""[h1]After years of deception, Metal Gear Solid series finally uncloaks before us PC Gamers.

13467771,76561197982572424,"This game is amazing.

Ground Zeroes is a playground. It gives you a bunch of tools and abilities and plops you down in a giant sandbox where you can use those things to your heart's content. This may only be a single prologue map, but the gameplay is deep enough that that's okay. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, doing things in different ways, trying out new things, or just goofing around. There are also alternate missions that change up the objectives as well as weather and time of day, creating a dramatically different looking and feeling game. 

On the technical side of things, the port is mostly excellent, especially considering it's a Japanese developer, some of whom are still learning how to make a proper PC port (See: Dark Souls 1, Deadly Premonition, Final Fantasy XIII at launch, etc.). But MGS5 has graphics options out the wazoo, arbitrary resolutions, and is incredibly well optimized. On my i7 4770k and HD 7950, I get a constant 60 FPS at 1080p with everything on Extra High except for Shadows and SSAO down a notch to just ""High"". It looks fantastic. The one mark against it is the 60 FPS cap - for someone as obsessed with framerate as Kojima, I would expect him to not artificially limit the framerate. 120 and 144 Hz monitors are becoming increasingly common. It's smooth enough at 60, but worth mentioning.

Some people malign this game as ""just paying for a demo of Phantom Pain"", but then this is the most feature-packed, most replayable, most awesome demo ever made, and (as you can see from my play time) I've gotten many hours of entertainment from it.

Leaving that behind, the game looks outstanding on budget based computers, I enjoyed it with 8 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon 5870 and a Core 2 Quad Q8400 at a stable framerate, the cutscenes are all real time like I would expect from a Kojima directed metal gear game, no pre-rendered crap like MG: Rising. The gameplay is fluid and intuitive, the music is outstanding and the enemy AI is pretty descent.

The story continues right after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, if you are new to the series, everything won't make much sense, there are some tapes and texts in the game that try to explain the events in the past games since MGS3: Snake Eater, but I would recommend playing or atleast watching a few videos about the story of Big Boss and his crew. 

I still don't understand why this was not included in the main game, just like in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, where you play the first part (prologue) with Snake and then you play the real game with Raiden. But still, it's a nice addition to the PC library of games, and a must have if you are a Metal Gear fan like myself.

13467298,76561198154112878,"As a huge MGS fan it's obvious I like this game. But what about those who never even touched an MGS game?

First off, this main game is short. Your first run on the main mission should take anywhere between 90 minutes or 3 hours at most. If you play just the main story and that's it, you'll be dissapointed. But if you like to complete side missions and have OCD, I feel you'll get your moneys worth with collecting all those XOF patches/cassette tapes, getting higher ranks, and finding new ways to complete missions.

As the for the gameplay, it's MGS at it's finest. Switching from crouching to crawling has never felt smoother, and it's actually hard to go back to something like MGS4 after playing this. And gunplay is great, especially with the new bullet drop effects, which makes you rethink about sniping someone across the map. My only complaint would have to be the cover mechanics. They're... quite awful to be honest. Hope they fix this in The Phantom Pain. Also no cardboard box. WTF?

The AI is pretty good as well. If you stand in broad daylight, it's obvious they'll see you 20 meters away, even on normal. And if you think reflex mode makes this game too easy, you're very mistaken. Especially when you get spotted by 3 guards and all you just shot a single shot tranq. Also, don't rely on regen health. Take too much damage, and you'll have to manually heal yourself with the marijuana health spray from Resident Evil. Realistic? No. But neither is eating rations that magically heal you after a point blank rocket launcher blast.

tl;dr version:

Pros are great replayability, lots of stuff to collect, gameplay, graphics, Hideo Kojima, and marijuana health spray.

Cons are short main mission, cover mechanics, no cardboard box, and too much water.

Overall I'd recommend this those who like to do everything in the game, have OCD, and want a great stealth experience.

Don't recommend if all you're here for is the main story. You'll feel ripped off. And hate water.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to attemp an S rank on the main mission.

13466488,76561197989601918,"I've been a fan of the Metal gear franchise ever since Metal gear Solid on the PS1, and I thought the franchise was finished after Peace Walker. I didn't have much hope for Metal Gear Solid V, and decided to buy Ground Zeroes with low expectations. What I expected was a mediocre console-to-PC port with similar gameplay to MGS4, which I had mixed opinions of.

I'm extremely pleased to say that any pessimism I had about the game has been blown out of the water. The PC version has a few technical issues, but it's nowhere near the copy-paste port that I've come to expect.

What really shines for this game is it's clean engine. Gameplay is fluid, non-stop, exciting and tese. The story is soaked with atmosphere and excellent voice acting accompanied by music from Harry Gregson-Williams, who has always produced top quality soundtracks for the series since he started with MGS2.  The graphics look phenomonal, and I have been playing on the default settings which were mostly set to high, and FPS was exceptional as well as looking great.

My only criticism is the decision to introduce Kiefer Sutherland as the voice actor for Big Boss, when previously in the series he was voiced by David Hayter. He fits the role well, and is a good choice, but for long standing fans, David Hayter will always be Snake.

I was also expecting it to be a demo with no content, but I have been pleasantly surprised and I'm going to be extremely entertained for hours, which will hopefully stave off the hype for Phantom Pain arriving.

13466037,76561198021827061,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a kind of prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Kind of like how the tanker chapter in MGS2 was a prequel to that game. Even though it's just a prologue this game is amazing.
I've heard complaints from crybabys like Angry Joe that the game was too expensive at release. I think it was about 40-50 dollars at release. Paying that amount of money for a game with an hour long campaign is kind of crazy. But this game is not meant to be played just once and be done with it, there are a lot of side-missions and some hidden collectibles that actually are difficult to find.

I'm going to start with the story and if you haven't played every other Metal Gear game before this, get out. Go out of here, find MGS HD collection for PS3 (I choose PS3 because reasons later), play Metal Gear 1 and 2, download and play Metal Gear Solid from PSN, go back to HD Collection, play MGS2 and MGS3, find a PSP, play MGS Portable Ops, go back to HD Collections play MGS Peace Walker, get a PS3 play MGS4, you can skip MGR:R because it's not important.
If you play this game as your first Metal Gear, you are a stupid cúnt just like Angry Joe.

Now, the story takes place 10 years after Snake Eater, following the Groznyj Grad incident with The Boss' death, and only a year after the Peace Walker incident.
After he fulfilled his mission he was awarded the title of Big Boss. Now he his still sad about The Boss' death, which is understandable because The Boss was the only woman who he ever loved. Big Boss has met with Kazuhira Miller, commonly known as Master Miller or just Master. Big Boss and Miller has started a private military company called Militaires Sans Frontières, translated Soldiers Without Borders. They got a mission to go to Cuba and drive out an unknown well-armed army. Yadayadayadayada. Big Boss finds out about a nuclear deterrant called Peace Walker, skip lots of story, it turns out the AI of Peace Walker is based on The Boss. At the end of the game is turns out the ghost of The Boss took over The Boss AI and drowned Peace Walker. The credits roll, but there are more story stuff after the game is done.
Turns out Paz is not a 16-year-old Costa Rican high school student, but a Cipher agent, she hijacks MSF's  Metal Gear ZEKE. Big Boss destroys it, she flees, gets captured by XOF, then this worthless kid Chico goes after her and he too gets captured. It's up to Big Boss to rescue them and the story is now in MGSV: GZ.
I'm cutting the story here, there's too much shít.

The gameplay is really good, if you play one of the newer MGS games you will have some serious problems playing MGS1, 2 and 3.
The stealth is more realistic in this one compared to the other ones, you don't get to change your camo to decrease your chances of getting spotted.
In the main mission it's at night and it's raining, it's pretty easy to not get spotted, but all of the side-missions play during daytime. It's sweet.

The music is pretty good, sound effects are also pretty good. Even the random conversations between soldiers are interesting. Not much more to say about that.

The game also looks fúcking gorgeous.

My final score for this game is actually 10/10 because it's a Hideo Freaking Kojima game, and as we all know Hideo Kojima is the biggest díck G ever. There are also multiple ways of beating this game, like sneaking onto a truck to get into the Admin Building.
I can't stretch it enough how much you shouldn't play this game if you haven't played all of the other Metal Gear games.
This game is short and sweet.
Even the bonus missions you unlock after collection all of the XOF patches are great. First one was originally a Playstation exclusive called Déjà Vu where you play as Big Boss, where you have to recreate scenes from Metal Gear Solid 1. Easily the best part of the game.
The second mission was a Xbox exclusive and is called Jamais Vu where you play as 2018 Raiden, it's lame.

If you are still here, reading this I've got to give you credit. This game is like the best game on Steam right now.

The gameplay is a more refined version of MGSIV. This ""game"" is very very very short. There is some replay value to it. But most will finish the single mission story mode in less than 2 hours.

But the main storyline of the game can be finished in about 40 minutes, and that's taking the cutscenes.

***SPOILERS****

you collect 2 hostages and leave the island. 

***kind of***


Even though the game reminds me to be stealthy there is no punishment for not doing that. After i accidentally got spotted in the first 10 seconds of the game and made my first kill I decided to go on a rampage just to see what happens.

and guess what? I ended up beating the game... I killed everyone in my sight and the game, after sending 2 waves of easily dispachable opponents, declared the area to be ""clear, and suspect lost"" so i just ran to the next spot and repeated.

at one point i was in a tank in the middle of base shooting all the waves of enemies game threw at me till they stopped coming. and again the area was declared ""safe"".... all while the hostage i was supposed to prottect was safely chilling next to my tank as i proceeded to slaugher innocent navy seals...

so basically, if you take away the cutscenes, and go in guns blazing, you can finish the game in something like 25 minutes... as a veteral splinter cell player I would call Bulls*it on ""stealth gameplay"" element of this game...

perhaps that is harder to do on ""hard"", however that doesn't really add to the replayability of the damn thing.
Thank god there are extra side missions to play after that so it's not a complete waste of money (even with the discount)

GOOD:

+The one area available has several missions that play pretty differently and have plenty of challenges/acheivements.
+Both console exclusive extra missions are included (a nostalgia trip for MGS1 and a Snatchers-mission starring Raiden from Rising)

13463248,76561198000043676,"this is a review from a MGS snake eater player i have not played the later installments due to console issues

that said, i enoyed the feel, controls, look, voice acting, and story. this is why mgs 3 was my favorite. Coming into this game and seeing all the changes threw me off. but i quickly learned that it was the same basic design only improved. no more sloppy aiming, no more vague CQC (close quarters combat), and very easy to learn stealth mechanics.

there are a few things that have been added that drasticly change the way mgs is played. the marking system, and the spotted system.

once spotted the game goes into slow motion, and shows the enemy that saw you. i both like and hate this, it creates a weird disconnect between normal exploration and sneaking into a slow motion quicktime. im not saying thats bad but in my opinion it makes it very different and jarring at first but extremely useful.

At the beggining of the game you are introduced to your binoculars which can help you scope out the area but it can also mark enemies. the marking of enemies has been in many games such as deus ex, farcry 3, splinter cell, and hitman.
its such an old and used concept that its strange to see it in a metal gear game especially when its never helped you keep track of enemies. like i said before i like and hate this, it makes it feel less like metal gear and more like splintercell.

You have to hold one key to enter interrogation [default: Q] and while you're holding said key you have to press another key with the same hand to choose a dialogue option [default: 1, 2, 3] which can be straining to many).
When trying to lean against some small cover (while crouching especially) Snake tends to put his head out just enough for anything on the other side to see which can be highly detremental for those just attempting to touch a surface of, for example, a small box. When that happens even trying to back your body out of sight can be difficult as Snake also tends to get his whole body out of cover.
The sensitivy for aiming in first person mode is way too high even when set to the lowest it can go in the options menu, which can highly affect perfect shots with snipers when looking through the lense or even just using the binoculars without looking too far off somewhere. A controller is much more recommended for these moments.

It's a third-person shooter when you let it become a shooter (which is unrecommended and isn't the initial point but that's the player's choice).
The guns work really well here; they spread quite a bit if you hold down the trigger too long (as with most other shooters) and there's bullet drop which is much more noticeable with the sniper and the tranquilizer gun.
It's a wonderful stealth game with incredible AI where the enemy can spot you immediately if you're seen close enough to them, though if you're far enough from view they'll just check out whatever unusual thing that was in the distance. If you're in view for too long too far away they'll ""check out a suspected individual"" or ""check out something suspicious going on."" Close enough to them and you're in view for too long they'll recognize you, set the whole area to combat status, and start engaging immediately (unless you neutralize them fast enough and if they're alone before they set the entire island into combat status) which you can then run and hide until the heat wears off or shoot back until you're in the clear, though reinforcements usually keep coming if they [i]notice[/i] that their live soldier count is dwindling. You can also experiment with how you can be sneaky in this game (ie: get most of the solders's attention away from your goal by detonating a C4 to destroy an AA gun that was placed really far away from where you're going).

[b]There are just so many great things in this game that I most likely still haven't even squeezed out despite my tons of hours and completion rate into it.

13462537,76561197996161207,"So here's the thing about Ground Zeroes. The gameplay? Fantastic. The graphics? Gorgeous. The story? Phenomenal. The controls? Well we need to talk. I played the game with my keyboard and mouse, but there are a few issues here and there. This game somewhat suffers from, ""Let's use every button!"" syndrome, though it's not that bad. For the most part, things make sense. WASD to move, shift is run, ctrl is tip-toe (I changed it to alt for personal reasons,) C is crouch, Space is a quick dodge dive thing, E is the action button, making you quickly climb up stuff when necessary, M1 is attack, M2 is aim, M3 switches brings the camera to the opposite shoulder, F looks through the goggles, R reloads... And then there's a mess of other stuff on random buttons.

Here's two fun examples of how this hurt the game:
 1 = Main Weapon, 2 = Sidearm, 3 = Throw Item, 4 = Night Vision Goggles. Holding 1 will let you change some addons for the main weapon, being its supressor and it's light. So your left hand is on 1. The buttons to change these things are X and Y, the same buttons used on the 360 controller. This can be a hassle when you're switching quickly.
Another example involves hold ups. If you get close to an enemy and then stick your gun to their back or in their face, they'll go arms up. You can then interrogate them by holding Q. So your right hand is holding M2 to bring your gun up, and your left hand is on Q. Then three options appear for talking, which are in a pattern indicating you control them with a direction. You try moving the mouse up, nothing happens. You press W, nothing happens. Turns out it's the arrow keys. First time I encountered this, I had to use my nose to tell this guy what to do, because Q needed to be pressed, and I needed to keep this guy in a stick-up with M2. I later discovered that using M2 was unnecessary when he was holding his arms up, although this was only from behind. My assumption is that they'll strike if you're in front of them when your weapon goes down.

So obviously the game has rebindable keys for the keyboard and mouse which is great, but what about the other options? There are graphics options a plenty, although one in particular, screen filter, I couldn't figure out what it actually did, so I left it turned off because I saw no difference. The game has no audio options, and although that's disappointing, if you're not wearing head phones while playing this, you're not using the game's well tuned audio to your advantage. Multiple times being able to hear where a vehicle was coming from saved me from getting caught by it. There is no FOV slider, although I don't believe it's necessary for a third person game. The field of view is analagous to reality, and the only time you got into first person is in first person gun aiming, and when using both the binoculars and the i-Droid.

In getting this game to work for me, I had to do multiple rebinds, but once I did, the game play was smooth as butter. It helped that I own an MMO mouse though, so I was able to map a few things to five through nine. The gameplay is phenomenal too. If you're a fan of the series and you're reading this, wondering if you should get the game, yes, you should. If you're a fan of stealth, you should still get the game, although if you're unfamiliar with the series, a few things might not make sense to you. It is true, the official single mission is short. It's about 2 hours to complete for the first time, although if you enjoy this game play, there's plenty more to do. There are multiple side ops, some being stealth, some being assassinations, and one even being a fly in and rescue battle, with a very amusing ending for fans of the series. There's also a secret side mission which unlocks once you collect all the XOF patches, which I'll let you discover for yourself.

The bottom line is, this game is fantastic, despite it's control flaws and short length, if you like stealth, this game is beyond worth it. There is plenty to explore and do, despite everything taking place in the same military compound, and you will have loads of fun playing it.

Oh, one last thing. If you're here expecting gameplay like Metal Gear Rising, then you're in the wrong place.

First, let me comment on playing this with Japanese voice.
To play this with Japanese audio, you'll have to set the game's language to Japanese through Steam; Steam will then proceed to download an additional 1.8 GB of data (presumably the Japanese audio files).
If you configured the game prior to changing the audio, such as tweaking the graphics or controls, you'll have to configure the game again.

You'll know if the game uses Japanese audio if it asks you to choose between 日本語 (Japanese) or English, and no other language. This ingame language selection only affects text, so don't choose Japanese unless you can read it, or changing the language will be a pain. If you can choose any other language, you are playing the international version with English voice acting.


Now to the actual game.
This is what games should be like: Solid performance (no pun intended) and hardly any noticeable bugs or issues without the need to install 3 day-one patches (looking at you, Ubisoft).

The main mission is unfortunately way too short and can be finished in half an hour if you know what to do and where to go, or less than 3 hours if you take your time.
If you're aiming for completion, however, you could easily be playing this game for over 20 hours, like I did on the PS4.

Gameplay-wise [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] might be a bit underwhelming for MGS veterans. The shift from Stealth to Action is very noticeable.
[list]
[*]It is no longer possible to knock on walls to attract guards; we do get an infinite amount of empty magazines to throw around, however.
[*]There is only one crawling speed; no more super-slow crawling. At least we can still roll around...
[*]Playing dead is also no longer possible, and there are no containers to hide in (no lockers or trash bins or similar).
[*]There's no camo; It's always weird to see a guard standing in front of a door, not noticing an old man dressed in a dark-blue skinsuit lying around in front of him while he's pointing a flashlight at said old man.
[*]And there's no cardboard box. Yes, I wasn't kidding when I said there were no containers to hide in.

At least we can still roll around...\n[*]Playing dead is also no longer possible, and there are no containers to hide in (no lockers or trash bins or similar).\n[*]There's no camo; It's always weird to see a guard standing in front of a door, not noticing an old man dressed in a dark-blue skinsuit lying around in front of him while he's pointing a flashlight at said old man.\n[*]And there's no cardboard box. Yes, I wasn't kidding when I said there were no containers to hide in.\n[/list]\n\nDespite all, this game is still pretty good and deserving recommendation.\nI spent a lot of time exploring all kinds of ways to get into Camp Omega, I spent a lot of time exploring all kinds of ways to get out again, and I'm going to do it all over again.

It is a short short ""game,"" honestly, it only took 60mins to finsish the Ground Zeros story driven section. And that was me taking my time, guessing where to go and just having fun. 

Gameplay is pretty flawless, really intuative. And some great features added (though I was dissapointed that I couldnt throw bodies over the cliff face to hide them, that is just stupid.)

Have moved onto the side missions, they are cool. Again, really feels like a testing ground for the mechanics really, and they are good fun. 

Graphically, amazing. And frame rate was a perfect 60, I didnt see even the slightest micro stutter from the game (970, 16gb ram with 2750k)

I recommend this, but buy it ASAP while it's on sale as it's one mission and a few hit missions after you finish the story line. 
It's a paid Prologue, and sort of a tech demo. 

The story, the little there is, is tradicional MGS. Corny sob-story with over-the-top elements and a plot that only makes sense if you are Japanese ( so I am told ) or you are high on LSD. Or both. That will make it better, I guess. Regardless of the story, it is enjoyable, as pretty much all Western games don't have such an original approach to story telling, plot and setting.  

Even though it's a port, maybe it's one of the best PC ports out there. It is capped at 60 fps, however, the cinematic filters employed make it that a 30fps experience is pleasant, even though this statement is an anithesis of what I have learned since the first 3dfx card came out. 
It's a well done and well optimized port.

Graphics are amazing! 

Controls are weird. After a while they become more natural, but still, it's noticeably done for console and then tweaked a bit for PC.

It is chock full of Kojima brilliance as you might expect and is sure to whet your appetite for The Phantom Pain. 

 The main mission for me only happened to only be about an hour long of solid game play, but that's because I somehow managed to breezily stumble through it like some drunken spy. I didn't do much in the way of exploration or score hunting, but there is plenty of that if you feel up to the challenge. It is certainly replayable, to say the least. A couple of things that didn't feel right to me, though, were the items and item cycling system, as well as the cover system. As far as items go, I didn't seem to find many things I could use or wanted to use and the cycling system didn't work well for me because, for one, it was 'different' than past installments, and, secondly, it was actually hard to move through it (I either couldn't figure out how to keep it ""still"" or it just wasn't possible to do so). For the cover system, my complaints aren't that it was difficult to get into cover, as I felt that I was able to very fluidly posistion myself up against whatever objectI was using as cover. The difficulties I experienced were related to sticking/posistioning and moving whilst in cover already. I constantly found myself ""falling off"" of objects and had a hard time navigating when pressed against something. I should mention I played with an Xbox controller (controls were ""confusing"" at first, but I got used to it) and that may have had an effect on my abilty to traverse cover.

That being said, I don't feel like you'll miss out if you chose to not play GROUND ZEROES and opt to go right into The Phantom Pain. It's nice if you're a fan and love the MG franchise (like myself), but you're likely to be dissapointed if you're new to the series and are looking for a game to play. Wait for The Phantom Pain if you're in the latter category. In fact, if you're new, brace yourself...because you're late as hell to an expansive and story rich game series.

Enjoy!


Edit: I should also mention that this game, from a technical standpoint, is gorgeous and plays very very smoothly. I don't have the best PC in the world and was worried I'd have performance issues (heh) but was pleasantly surprised that I experienced nothing of the sort. This was run on a mix of medium/high settings and I run a GeForce 650 (don't laugh). Excellence from Kojima as always.

Edit 2:
So, I've played a lot more since I wrote the review. I have to say, all the bonus content and awesome Kojima easter eggs are so so satisfying.

13457158,76561197964866568,"Just a demo version of Phantom Pain that you have to pay for.
But a great demo at that.
All you get is a small area that you can treat like a sandbox. Main objective lasts for about 30 minutes, but there are other objectives after that and achievements you can unlock. Cool way to wait for Phantom Pain. Affordable at a discount, not really worth it for the full initial price though.
The content is good. PC version has all the stuff that consoles had released, so overall, It can suffice for quite few hours altoghether. 
It doesn't FEEL like a full game though. Grapics are quite decent at max, but not overly spectacular.
The biggest shortcoming I would notice, is that it looks very similiar to Splinter Cell at this point, but it didn't loose all the MGS feel yet.

13454593,76561198084478605,"Looking at the minimum requirements, you'd think this game will never run fine on anything but the top PC gear. However, the good news is that it turns out not to be the case. Mine is a reliable but old setup: AMD HD6950 2GB GPU, with an Intel i5-3570K OC'd to a safe 4.2GHz and 8GB DDR3 RAM. 

The game looks gorgeous and still runs at a smooth 60FPS on 1080p, with most settings on Extra High, except for the various Filters and Shadows, which I left on High, as they seemed to cause occasional drops. Not a big problem, but if you have a better and newer GPU than mine, I believe you won't encounter the slightest issue at this resolution, as the stress definitely isn't on the CPU.

Speaking of another aspect of the port, the mouse+keyboard controls are—for the most part—done really well. If you can get past having to use exclusively your keyboard on the various menu screens, I'd say the controls are pretty intuitive once you have spent a few minutes on them. I also must say I've never expected to enjoy playing a MGS game using anything other than a gamepad, but I've been proven wrong.

The other advantage of having this game on PC seems to be given by the versatility and overall quality of the Fox Engine, which people have taken very little time to exploit in forms of texture and/or model replacements that yield results such as being able to play as Chico or Kaz against soldiers resembling Big Boss, or something as absurd as replacing the crows' model for a human one, which looks as funny as it sounds. Before long, we may have fully fledged mods that add up to the game or even become games of their own, one baby step at a time. 

As for the game itself, it has one main mission which will take you anything from 20 minutes to 2 hours to complete, depending on your approach and expertise. Its function is to set the stage for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and it's the only mission with relevance to the plot. Of course, there are side and extra missions which will keep you busy for a few more hours if gameplay is what you're mainly looking for.

I would recommend this technically very good port to any long-standing fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise who doesn't mind a bit of redundancy in terms of overall setting on the way of some nice fan service extras. I can't particularly recommend it to newcomers, as it doesn't really give the best of ideas of what the franchise is about, and it might be a tad confusing for someone who hasn't followed the storyline. 

To those, I would definitely recommend looking back to the older titles, most of which (excluding the rather important original Metal Gear Solid, in fact) can be found in the HD collection for PS3, PSVita and Xbox 360, if you have a console. Special mention goes to Metal Gear Solid 3 (originally released on PS2), which is a masterfully crafted installment that narrates the story of how Big Boss came to be.

A final aspect I would reflect upon is whether the current price tag is worth it for the average consumer. If you have slight doubts, I'd in fact hold off and wait for a sale, as the upcoming title will definitely steal the show and provide much more valuable content than this.

almost perfect port.

My opinion on this one: Great controls, Graphics, Story and much fun to be had.

Definately around 50-100 hours of content for me to enjoy here - So many different ways to approach scenarios.

Being able to unlock PS1 Snake and Grey Fox?

Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake? At first I thought this would be terrible but after giving it a go? You can definately see why this became a thing.

Great price for a great game.

It's not a demo, even though it gives you just enough content to be dying for more.

However...

Metal Gear Solid 4 was a system seller for me. It's WHY I bought a Playstation 3. However there's literally nothing Sony can do to sell me a Playstation product anymore so even this near demo coming out on Steam is amazing for me.
Currently running a core 2 duo with 6 GB of DDR2 & a GeForce GTX 650 TI I wasn't actually expecting this game to run. However it runs... it runs very well in fact. With the game chosen settings of mostly medium settings with a couple high settings the game has demonstrated no lag what so ever so far. 
Running better then any other action military game has for awhile on my system I'm very pleased. It runs MUCH better than Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier does & Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare on this system is just a bad joke.
Even runs better then Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist but not amazingly better.
So far it feels & controls exactly like I expect a Metal Gear Solid game to do. The back story option on the menu is also very welcome since I have not finished Snake Eater at all (seriously screw escort missions in a military combat action game...). Also I have hardly played any of the newer Metal Gear products... just a bit of time (not even 1/4 of the game) in the PS3 HD collection meaning I've lost track of the story line long ago.
This is the right product for the price (including the -33% daily deal on that is... full $20 is pushing it but I would have bought anyways since it's MGS) however it is a limited scope; I haven't explored too far yet however the map does seem a bit small.
Over all... 9/10 stars but only because it's basically a demo with a small map. 
And Kojima? Make MGS 4 & HD collection for PC please... I'll give you my first born child (Note: I do not & probably will never have children).",1419011567,1419011567,1,0.5250318050384521,1139,295,1698064030,"{""recommendationid"": ""13453672"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197968994186"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 109, ""playtime_forever"": 1139, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 295, ""last_played"": 1698064030}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Metal Gear Solid.

So, what can I say about Ground Zeroes? First and foremost, I'm really impressed with the production quality. The visuals are well detailed and beautiful, the VA is top notch (huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland), gameplay is excellent, animations are really well done and don't feel choppy like the ones in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Level design is really good and allow multiple ways of completing mission objectives.

The enemy AI is quite good and the enemies don't feel like dumb robots that can't see you moving right in front of their eyes. They will perform searches and communicate with each other to some degree, like when the spotlight guy detects you and ask nearby soldiers to investigate. When you get spotted and they raise the alert level, you'll see lots of enemies converging to your last known position and start looking for you, and that's something I like to see in this kind of game.

On a technical level, this is a really good port. It runs silky smooth at 60fps with all the bells and whistles on my average rig - i5 3570k, 16GB RAM, GTX 760. The mouse/keyboard controls are surprisingly good and the default mapping is efficient and comfortable. It's not perfect tho: you can't use the mouse pointer to navigate menus, you must use your keyboard.

Overall, it's worth every penny I paid for it, and I can't wait for The Phantom Pain!

- very good keyboard/mouse controls

PROS:
It's becautiful, compared to some AAA games of recent
It runs well, on a 3 year old PC I managed to get 60FPS with a mix of high and medium settings
Mouse controls are good
As an MGS fan, my snake was solid, 10/10 would Fission mail again

CONS:
It's obviously a console port, the menus are almost entirely keyboard controlled
This is like paying £12 for a DLC, it's just one mission.
Ai is a bit thick, and there's no real indicator of what they are doing, so you're stuck guessing

Overall, I'm not unhappy that I bought this, though I'd much rather have saved this money for the full release, Phantom Pain. Get it if you are in need of something to hold you over till the real MGS V comes out.

13451686,76561197969648577,"GROUND ZEROES is a fantastic achievement from Kojima Productions, not just in regards to its excellent world buliding, game mechanics and storytelling, but also with respect to the excellent PC release.  Regarding the game itself, it's excellent albeit brief.  If the idea of replaying missions to try alternate strategies or to beat your score, it's probably best to hold off for the main dish when PHANTOM PAIN is released next year.  If you enjoy replaying missions, self-improvement and pushing at the seams of open world gameplay, then GROUND ZEROES is an absolute must-play.

I won't go into it too much here, but there's reason for healthy discussion on the game's treatment of its sole female character.

13450738,76561197982492460,"Alright, so it's finally here, and we PC gamers have been waiting for this - a solid MGS port. Now's our shot to show Kojima's efforts to make this (very polished) port was not in vain and to continue looking to PC gaming as a viable market for the series.

Onto the game:

So it's short. It's meant to be a prologue to the upcoming MGS V: The Phantom Pain, so don't expect a full-fledged game. This takes place after MGS Peacewalker, but it does have a decent little backstory section to catch you up to speed since MGS3. 

It's a AAA series, and the pricetag should reflect that it's really more of a teaser. The pricetag might be a little steep for some considering the lack of content, but don't let that scare you off if you're a fan of the series. It's got a lot of replay value and tons of little side missions to keep you entertained. If you've never played an MGS game before,  might not want to jump right into this one, so if you've got the option to do so, go ahead and play the series. It's a great one, I promise. This series was my childhood right here.

So it's short but replayable, and currently on sale for $13.39. What makes it worth it?

For starters, it's optimized perfectly. I can run this totally maxed on my rig (which isn't the best, but it's certainly pretty good) at 45-60fps stable, and the graphics look absolutely phenomenal. It's very cutting-edge, especially when you see how the cutscenes are rendered in the game engine. No pre-rendered garbage here - it's all done in Kojima's shiny new Fox Engine. Tacking onto that, it has 4k support, for those with the hardware. That might be of interest to people who have that capability, but even on my 1080 monitor, this game looks just gorgeous. The screenshots I'm sure you'll see on the store page and by other users don't lie - it's great. The graphics options are there, no worries. We've got a good array of choices to tweak how this game looks, so Kojima certainly delivered there.

Other than that, the controls are a concern for many, I'm sure. A keyboard and mouse might seem a little odd for an MGS game, but take my word for it PLEASE - it works so well here. It all feels smooth and very natural - the keys are right where you'd expect them to be and you can easily rebind them to your liking. The game also has controller support for those who fancy that, but I can't say I've personally tried it. Basically: the controls wil work for you no matter what medium you choose.

So the main story may be short and easy to burn through, the side ops aren't extremely plentiful (Although they're fun as hell, seriously), but the game is extremely well-done all around. At a sale like the one currently, it's a steal for anyone looking to enjoy the game on a new medium. This is how PC ports should be done. Kojima Productions set a high standard for any company looking to port a console game to PC.

I did have an issue, by the way, launching the game where it would never open when I'd launch it. Some say removing gaming peripherals fixed this, others say running it at 800x600 to start it up helped, others had to install the redistributed files and reboot. For me, a simple reboot fixed my issues and I'm currently enjoying the game just fine.

I'm sure those will be patched ASAP, but there's that for those who run into any of those issues. Check the forums, lots of people are listing many fixes for these launch bugs. Little disappointing, but I think the game itself makes up for the small hiccups (Maybe it was just rushed a little to get it out for day one of the winter sales?)

Anyway, long story short: Here's our shot to show Kojima his work to bring this game to PC is a smart one. If you're a fan of the series and want to show Kojima that we're a viable market, don't hesitate. Even if you own it on another platform, it's worth having this gem in your library. You won't regret it. It runs like a dream and keeps you entertained for a good while. I spend most of my time taking great eye-candy screenshots, and with a game like this, I'm sure you will, too.

It's not without some launch flaws and it's certainly not a massive MGS title (And the pricetag may look a little steep for what you're getting) but I have to say, I don't regret it. It feels like MGS has found a new home: my PC library where it belongs.",1419001755,1419001755,1,0.5,2407,131,1441100480,"{""recommendationid"": ""13450738"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197982492460"", ""num_games_owned"": 385, ""num_reviews"": 4, ""playtime_forever"": 2407, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 131, ""last_played"": 1441100480}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Alright, so it's finally here, and we PC gamers have been waiting for this - a solid MGS port. Now's our shot to show Kojima's efforts to make this (very polished) port was not in vain and to continue looking to PC gaming as a viable market for the series.\n\nOnto the game:\n\nSo it's short. It's meant to be a prologue to the upcoming MGS V: The Phantom Pain, so don't expect a full-fledged game. This takes place after MGS Peacewalker, but it does have a decent little backstory section to catch you up to speed since MGS3. \n\nIt's a AAA series, and the pricetag should reflect that it's really more of a teaser. The pricetag might be a little steep for some considering the lack of content, but don't let that scare you off if you're a fan of the series. It's got a lot of replay value and tons of little side missions to keep you entertained. If you've never played an MGS game before,  might not want to jump right into this one, so if you've got the option to do so, go ahead and play the series. It's a great one, I promise. This series was my childhood right here.\n\nSo it's short but replayable, and currently on sale for $13.39. What makes it worth it?\n\nFor starters, it's optimized perfectly. I can run this totally maxed on my rig (which isn't the best, but it's certainly pretty good) at 45-60fps stable, and the graphics look absolutely phenomenal. It's very cutting-edge, especially when you see how the cutscenes are rendered in the game engine. No pre-rendered garbage here - it's all done in Kojima's shiny new Fox Engine. Tacking onto that, it has 4k support, for those with the hardware. That might be of interest to people who have that capability, but even on my 1080 monitor, this game looks just gorgeous. The screenshots I'm sure you'll see on the store page and by other users don't lie - it's great. The graphics options are there, no worries. We've got a good array of choices to tweak how this game looks, so Kojima certainly delivered there.\n\nOther than that, the controls are a concern for many, I'm sure. A keyboard and mouse might seem a little odd for an MGS game, but take my word for it PLEASE - it works so well here. It all feels smooth and very natural - the keys are right where you'd expect them to be and you can easily rebind them to your liking. The game also has controller support for those who fancy that, but I can't say I've personally tried it. Basically: the controls wil work for you no matter what medium you choose.\n\nSo the main story may be short and easy to burn through, the side ops aren't extremely plentiful (Although they're fun as hell, seriously), but the game is extremely well-done all around. At a sale like the one currently, it's a steal for anyone looking to enjoy the game on a new medium. This is how PC ports should be done. Kojima Productions set a high standard for any company looking to port a console game to PC.\n\nI did have an issue, by the way, launching the game where it would never open when I'd launch it. Some say removing gaming peripherals fixed this, others say running it at 800x600 to start it up helped, others had to install the redistributed files and reboot. For me, a simple reboot fixed my issues and I'm currently enjoying the game just fine.\n\nI'm sure those will be patched ASAP, but there's that for those who run into any of those issues. Check the forums, lots of people are listing many fixes for these launch bugs. Little disappointing, but I think the game itself makes up for the small hiccups (Maybe it was just rushed a little to get it out for day one of the winter sales?)\n\nAnyway, long story short: Here's our shot to show Kojima his work to bring this game to PC is a smart one. If you're a fan of the series and want to show Kojima that we're a viable market, don't hesitate. Even if you own it on another platform, it's worth having this gem in your library.

About 2 hrs for the main mission but still an enjoyable one. This game, Ground Zeroes, is just a teaser/intro to The Phantom Pain, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the time. It brings a whole new aspect to MGS where you get to play like a maniac without getting killed so easily, which will be a negative to the die-hard MGS fans. The game has a mixed bag of feelings to that of FPS shooters and uncharted/tomb raider, which may or may not be a good thing for some people - in my opinion, it's a bad thing.

Since this game is a 1 mission prologue to MGS:TPP, I'm hoping TPP brings back things like food gathering and collection kits for weapons/first aid.

13450013,76561197983646664,"Pros:

-Amazing visuals. This is what a 'next-gen' game is supposed to look like. Hats off to Kojima's artists, they really earned their paychecks here. From the modelling, animations, texturing, etc. It all comes together beautifully.

-Tight controls. Gone are the days from older games where you had to check a menu just to figure out all sorts of button press combinations just to do semi-secret moves regarding CQC and such. It's been streamlined in a manner that's much more quick to pull off, without feeling overly trivialized.

-Solid gameplay. At no point did it ever feel janky or 'cheap'. Everything behaves in ways you ought to expect it, from how your character interacts with the environment, to the handling of weapons and the behaviour of your enemy.

-A couple of new tricks up Snake's sleeve. Interrogations and such are now a neat little thing.

-Lots of side-content. I didn't realize until I beat the game that you end up unlocking tons of side missions after the fact that you can play after, which is a good thing, because of a point I'll be getting to in the cons.


Cons:
-It's short. Like. SUPER short. Way shorter than you'd think, even for a 15 dollar AAA game. If you knew what you were doing and didn't mind shooting your way through objectives, you could beat the entire 'main' game in 15-20 minutes easily. It took me roughly an hour and a half on my first playthrough, and that's because I went the wrong way initially and had to double back through the entire map.

-Stealth is kind of a joke. There isn't much punishment for getting spotted, and if you've ever played a third person shooter before, you can go guns blazing through this no problem. It's steath elements are merely a suggestion for the sake of challenge, rather than necessity, and thus, this isn't a real stealth game. This is action-adventure.

-Easy difficulty in general. There just isn't much in the way of punishment in this game, and it gives you too many means of just rambo'ing your way through should you mess up. Reflex time is a dumb addition clearly meant to hold the hands of newer players, but when you make such concessions, how do you expect new players to ever learn and improve? This little 'feature' can be turned off in options, but unfortunately it's on by default and you must go looking for it. Oh, did I also mention 'regenerating health' is now a thing? You can already bet your boots that Phantom Pain's online component is going to have unlock progression at this rate. Too many 'modern gaming industry' gimmicks sour the gameplay experience by removing all tension from stealth and combat.

-Ending cutscenes deprive you of interaction at some really cool segments. I wont drop any spoilers, but there will be points at the end when you scratch your head and ask yourself ""Why don't I get to play this part? Why am I watching the game have it's own fun?""

-Story wise, the game assumes you've played the more obscure titles on the PSP, a handheld that, frankly, not many people even owned in the first place. If games like Peacewalker were made available on consoles and PC, it would serve rather well to dispel some of the confusion of the plot that is loosely explained in text snippets that you have to look up on your own in the main menu outside of the in-game experience.

Overall:

I had a great deal of fun with this, even with some of it's shortcomings, they paled in comparison to the overall potential of the game. With only 8% completion after beating the 'main course', I've got a decent amount of replayability to knock out before I can truly write this game off as 'done'. While I'm not completely sold on this model of game distribution just yet due to how long it's taking to get Phantom Pain out, I can honestly say this game is worth the $14 dollar price tag it's asking for while on sale at the moment. On it's surface, it's got a 'demo' feel to it, but once you dive into some of the offered extra content, you're getting more bang for your buck than the typical 15 dollar indie zombie survival minecraft rip-off trite that gets regurgitated out of Greenlight at around this price range. I know one thing though: This game is a quantum-powered hype train for Phantom Pain. Once you make your way through this, the wait for the next stage of the franchise will be nearly unbearable, and thus, I have to fully recommend this game.",1418999553,1419000145,1,0.4350263774394989,302,226,1441218406,"{""recommendationid"": ""13450013"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197983646664"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 40, ""playtime_forever"": 302, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 226, ""last_played"": 1441218406}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Pros:\n\n-Amazing visuals.

It took me roughly an hour and a half on my first playthrough, and that's because I went the wrong way initially and had to double back through the entire map.\n\n-Stealth is kind of a joke. There isn't much punishment for getting spotted, and if you've ever played a third person shooter before, you can go guns blazing through this no problem. It's steath elements are merely a suggestion for the sake of challenge, rather than necessity, and thus, this isn't a real stealth game. This is action-adventure.\n\n-Easy difficulty in general. There just isn't much in the way of punishment in this game, and it gives you too many means of just rambo'ing your way through should you mess up. Reflex time is a dumb addition clearly meant to hold the hands of newer players, but when you make such concessions, how do you expect new players to ever learn and improve? This little 'feature' can be turned off in options, but unfortunately it's on by default and you must go looking for it. Oh, did I also mention 'regenerating health' is now a thing? You can already bet your boots that Phantom Pain's online component is going to have unlock progression at this rate. Too many 'modern gaming industry' gimmicks sour the gameplay experience by removing all tension from stealth and combat.\n\n-Ending cutscenes deprive you of interaction at some really cool segments. I wont drop any spoilers, but there will be points at the end when you scratch your head and ask yourself \""Why don't I get to play this part? Why am I watching the game have it's own fun?\""\n\n-Story wise, the game assumes you've played the more obscure titles on the PSP, a handheld that, frankly, not many people even owned in the first place. If games like Peacewalker were made available on consoles and PC, it would serve rather well to dispel some of the confusion of the plot that is loosely explained in text snippets that you have to look up on your own in the main menu outside of the in-game experience.\n\nOverall:\n\nI had a great deal of fun with this, even with some of it's shortcomings, they paled in comparison to the overall potential of the game. With only 8% completion after beating the 'main course', I've got a decent amount of replayability to knock out before I can truly write this game off as 'done'. While I'm not completely sold on this model of game distribution just yet due to how long it's taking to get Phantom Pain out, I can honestly say this game is worth the $14 dollar price tag it's asking for while on sale at the moment. On it's surface, it's got a 'demo' feel to it, but once you dive into some of the offered extra content, you're getting more bang for your buck than the typical 15 dollar indie zombie survival minecraft rip-off trite that gets regurgitated out of Greenlight at around this price range. I know one thing though: This game is a quantum-powered hype train for Phantom Pain. Once you make your way through this, the wait for the next stage of the franchise will be nearly unbearable, and thus, I have to fully recommend this game."", ""timestamp_created"": 1418999553, ""timestamp_updated"": 1419000145, ""voted_up"": true, ""votes_up"": 3, ""votes_funny"": 0, ""weighted_vote_score"": ""0.435026377439498901"", ""comment_count"": 0, ""steam_purchase"": true, ""received_for_free"": false, ""written_during_early_access"": false, ""primarily_steam_deck"": false}"

After playing all of the previous games on consoles, playing with the keyboard is a little strange at first, but I eventually got used to it after just a little bit. Although, I did go through and adjust some of the default controls because they didn't make any sense to me. For instance, when you're using your binoculars (by holding F) and you want to zoom in you have to press 'V'. How they expect someone to do this, I'm not exactly sure since the 'v' key is right below the ' f ' key that you're holding. Also, it's a good idea to change your slow-walk button to shift, and set sprint to ctrl since you're gonna be spending a lot more time walking slowly than sprinting.

In total, I changed my controls to:

slow-walk: shift
sprint: ctrl
switch shoulder: f
First-person aiming: v
binoculars: t
binocular-zoom: right-click

besides that, everything was comfy.

My first time through the main mission was awesome. I got caught a couple of times and had to fight my way out which was a little embarrassing. I'm actually pretty excited to play through it again and see how quickly I can get past everyone without being spotted.

The only main mission is short but if you like exploring and doing the side missions, or improving the way you play to achieve s-ranks, I assume it can last more than 20-30 hours, which is way more than some games sold at $40 or $50.

The scenario is good. Since the game is short there's not too much material to base my judgment on but it seems to efficiently link Peace Walker, which I recommend playing, to the upcoming The Phantom Pain.

Sound effects, voices and music are once again flawless as in every MGS game. I miss David Hayter's acting a lot but Kiefer Sutherland does a good job too.

Controls are logic and easy to learn, Big Boss' movements are slick and responsive. I still haven't figured how to dive/dash despite of the prompts but I'll eventually understand.

Aim assistance and ""reflex mode"" - which slows time when you're spotted - can be deactivated.

The Fox Engine is gorgeous and the game is amazingly well optimized. Note the fact that it's a developper that doesn't usually develop for PC, yet does a better job at it that a lot of other companies.

At a technical level it's absolutely mind blowing that it runs as well as it does. I'm maxing out the game at 1080p and I'm hitting a stable 60FPS while only using 35% of my GPU (GTX970). I have never seen my GPU usage so low while maintaining such a high framerate. Not even one dip below. I did run into 2 issues with the port however. First one is that V-Sync is a must, the amount of screen tearing without it is beyond words. I haven't seen tearing this bad in a very long time. The other issue is that the game seems to hate multi-monitor software such as DisplayFusion and Vertical Taskbars. If you have either of those (or both like me) you may need to close the software and hide the taskbar. If not the game will either give you a lovely 640x480 window (http://i.imgur.com/e2GLCke.jpg) that can't be changed or it will give you a taskbar that is permanently on screen (http://i.imgur.com/SmxQNCs.jpg).  outside of these 2 issues the port is perfect.

The game itself is a blast to play. It's a great taste of things to come in ""The Phantom Pain"". The main mission itself took me 61 minutes first go and while I found it to be a bit too easy (1 retry, 0 kills, 0 alerts) the experience that it gave me overall was spectacular. If Phantom Pain is basically a 20+ hour version of this I'm so down. Also, while the main mission only clocks in at an hour first go around that only accounted for 8% of the game completition according to my stats. There are a fair amount of side missions you can do and a few hidden things to collect along with another difficulty. There is content here beyond the main story. 

Overall, it's a great game and while the name ""Demo Gear Solid"" is true to an extent, this is most definitely worth a purchase if you just can't wait any longer for Phantom Pain.

Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours
That agony is your triumph""

The next chapter in the amazing Metal Gear Series, and first to come to Steam, lives up to the hype and delivers a powerful story with much improved gameplay.
Being on the new 'Fox' engine, Metal Gear Solid feels more realistic with not only looks but the way the world is. Enemies react better and move more natrually as well as fight with a better understanding of how to hide and survive a battle. Vehicles move around and people talk to each other in normal conversation. All in all, the game looks and feels great with the addition of graphic options to suits your PC's needs.
The story is a lot darker and there are a couple grim scenes that I winced at slightly. But this just goes to show how far people are willing to go in their own personal agenda's.
For the price is also the addition of the DLC packs, jamais vu and deju vu, achievements and things that will be unlocked in The Phantom Pain upon release.

(I am not counting the playtime and the game's short length because by now, if they had looked into the console releases, people would have known about the games short length and therefore saved themselves the complaining for when it came out on Steam.)

Highly reccomended if you are a big fan of Metal Gear Solid.

Compared to the prior, more linear MGS games, you have an open world to play the mission in any way you like.
Guards also aren't as predictable anymore, you have to change your tactics on the fly and it makes for great replayability.

The only downside is that this is just a prologue for the Phantom Pain and therefore the main mission is a bit short.
But they make up for it with great gameplay, an amazing story and side missions that will get you a few more hours out of the game.
It also is an amazing port that runs incredibly well. It's overall a really polished game and for the current price, you can't go wrong with it.

13446317,76561198071376085,"Great game. Runs perfectly on my system. Constant 60FPS, everything maxed out on a 780 Ti. I heard that this game was really short, and I'm surprised to see that it actually has a fair amount of content. The main 'Ground Zeroes' mission took about 2 hours for me, and since then I've been playing the side-ops.  If you're a big Metal Gear fan you're gonna want to unlock all the cassette tapes to learn more about the crazy MGS story, and that should take a good amount of time. Along with collecting the XOF patches that unlock two extra missions I believe. So I think I'll be playing the game for awhile.

One thing I've noticed about this iteration of MGS is that it has gotten a lot darker. There is still some wacky sh*t like a Hideo Kojima cameo, but it deals with some pretty grim subject matter such as pedophilia and rape. Makes you feel pretty uncomfortable. The gameplay is the best it has ever been. It's just fun running around, sneaking up on people and smacking them around with CQC. And the non-linear progression allows you to tackle your mission in various ways, with various opening to exploit which is great.

They also added vehicles which I didn't use that often because I tried to remain undetected and It seems like you're screwing yourself over by driving around in clear view. Also, I thought I was going to be pissed off because of the lack of David Hayter, but I honestly think it's an improvement.

Runs perfectly on my system. Constant 60FPS, everything maxed out on a 780 Ti. I heard that this game was really short, and I'm surprised to see that it actually has a fair amount of content. The main 'Ground Zeroes' mission took about 2 hours for me, and since then I've been playing the side-ops.  If you're a big Metal Gear fan you're gonna want to unlock all the cassette tapes to learn more about the crazy MGS story, and that should take a good amount of time. Along with collecting the XOF patches that unlock two extra missions I believe. So I think I'll be playing the game for awhile.\n\nOne thing I've noticed about this iteration of MGS is that it has gotten a lot darker. There is still some wacky sh*t like a Hideo Kojima cameo, but it deals with some pretty grim subject matter such as pedophilia and rape. Makes you feel pretty uncomfortable. The gameplay is the best it has ever been. It's just fun running around, sneaking up on people and smacking them around with CQC. And the non-linear progression allows you to tackle your mission in various ways, with various opening to exploit which is great.\n\nThey also added vehicles which I didn't use that often because I tried to remain undetected and It seems like you're screwing yourself over by driving around in clear view. Also, I thought I was going to be pissed off because of the lack of David Hayter, but I honestly think it's an improvement. I don't know that much about Kiefer Sutherland so his voice didn't seem out of place or weird to me, and it's a lot more professional and less cheesy.\n\nOverall, I really have no complaints about this game.

Now about game itself.

Story:
 Many people have problem understanding why Big Boss is snake and how he is connected to Solid Snake but that will occur with young player who most probably were not even born when i played MGS 1. So you should play entire 
franchise of MGS series to understand compex sotry behind Snake who is cloned from Big Boss, governments, cold war and what nobody likes to talk is what happens to people on battlefield and after they survive it. What is left of man when he fights between two storms and none is good, only difference is what kind of evil will replace different kind of evil. There is no victory for humanity in the end of day only domination of one force above other and special interest shifting between them which is mercenaries like Big Boss. As we can see in prologe American base (black site) is on communistic soil in Cuba fighting against communistic Russia or SSSR doing to prisoners same things as SSSR which is hypocrite of hypocrisy.
 So for young players I recommend this game as one of best games with story, gameplay and Hideo Kojima even says on his site KONAMI that this is result of deep reasearch so most parts from game are made by real events or inspired by real events.

Gee, what can I say, honestly this game is like an art form of it's own, a prelude to the game that will follow, A.K.A. The Phantom Pain

Let's talk about the game a little

-------------------------------
GAMEPLAY
-------------------------------

You play as Big Boss, one of the most elite soldiers during the cold war era, and as such he comes with his own unique skillset. Boss is a master of sneaking, and as such he is instructed to complete all his missions stealthily, and with no backup. 

Equipment is procured on site, and you have to rely on your own wits and good luck.  The controls are perfectly optimized for keyboard and mouse, although it is playable and quite enjoyable with a controller. 

The enemy AI is amazing, enemies act according to the situation which is going on, and their eyesight is sharp, meaning you have to be really careful when sneaking around

-----------------------
STORY
-----------------------
Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes is a prelude to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It begins with Big Boss infiltrating a black site in Cuba, or as Kaz would call it ""A little slice of American pie on commie soil""

There, he is instructed to exfil two members of Big Boss' ""Army Without Borders"", Paz Ortega Andrade and Ricardo Valenciano Libre (also known as Chico). Paz was captured, and Chico went in after her because he loves her. I really cannot reveal much, you have to find out most of it for yourself. 

-----------------------------------
OVERALL
-----------------------------------

A very good port, excellently optimized, and with a great story and gameplay. I believe this game is just a stepping stone for Metal Gear games to finally appear on PC, and we might actually witness this in the near future.

Game is a 10/10, I would definitely recommend it.

13445078,76561198043163536,"Metal Gear Sold V: Ground Zeroes is a fantastic game. Though there's only a single map that's honestly not very large, the map itself and the NPCs populating it are so wonderfully crafted that each of the 7 missions you can play on it all feel like a new experience. 

But there're loads of sites and other reviews you can look at if you're interested in whether or not the game itself is good, as it's been out for around 9 months now on consoles.

I will however talk about it's port (may or may not be an actual port) quality, which everyone and their dog's mom is saying is the best of the year.

While it is a fantastic ""port"", it's only a fantastic ""port"" in terms of performance. In other areas like graphics options, audio options and key rebinding, it has a lot of problems. 

Key rebinding is pretty good for the most part, unless of course you're left handed or if you're someone who binds to the right side of the keyboard. Be prepared to use a controller because you can't bind ANYTHING to the numpad or any other keys on the right side besides ""Page Up"" ""Page Down"" and the cursor keys. This is a major problem for those of us who don't or can't use the left side of the keyboard due to physical disabilities or simply being left handed.

I've been forced to use a controller to play it since I use the mouse with my left hand. And I certainly won't be buying MGSV Phantom Pain unless the problems this game has aren't present in it.

The audio options menu is non existent. There are no ways whatsoever to adjust the volume of different sounds, no way to change the audio output device while in-game. There's not even a menu for audio options.

The graphics options menu has a decent amount of options, but they're all very poorly presented. The game is locked to 60hz, Vsync is always on, AA and DOF are wrapped up into a single ""Low"" ""High"" ""Extra High"" or ""Off"" option, and other options like Texture Filtering are restricted to the same ""Low"" ""High"" ""Off"" method.

All in all you'll probably be able to get this to a playable framerate on just about any peice of modern hardware, but other than that, it's an okay port at best.

Superior port. No bugs, crashes, works like a charm. Maxed out on i5-4670k, 8gb ram and gtx970, rock solid 60 fps. It's  beautifull game, fox engine can do wonders, great atention to details.

Game is quite short, but has a little bit of replayability, after the main mission you can go back and do a couple of extra missions, rescue hostages, kill some high value targets etc. Also, it's quite cheap atm, so go and get it while it's still hot!

Snake, welcome back on PC, we hope you'll stay a while longer :)

Now i really can't wait for Phantom Pain......

I knew it was short (well, main mission was short) and I knew it was basically a prequel for when Phantom Pain comes out, but I must say it's a solid experience (didn't really intend for the pun, but there you go)

My current setup is bellow the minimum specs they list, and I was able to play the game smoothly with most settings on high, save for 2 that were on medium.  For under minimum specs, that's impressive (I think they just really want people to play with the most highest settings, so higher specs)

The gameplay is smooth, the controls work well with the keyboard & mouse, and it's an interesting little mission that goes between peace walker and the game to come.

I'm nowhere near completing the game, but I think it'll be fun finding all the extra little things, and doing the side missions, as even though they're all in the same area, they'll put emphasis on diferent styles of gameplay.

With the starting price of 13.39, I'm satisfied with my purchase, and I've only scratched the surface of this game.

---Firstly, I'd like to thank the developers for making the game run smoothly, especially for what it is offering. These days you see lazy ports and developers often blame others.---

Now onto my review and some information ( for those who might be wondering ) about the game.
The game is well optimized for the PC and offers several options to adjust visual settings, easily making it the definitive version. The options menu also has key assigning, so you can easily switch what key does what to conform to your liking. Mouse movement is amazingly responsive. Movement is smooth and there are options to adjust your mouse sensitivity, so you don't worry about having to use a controller.
Currently using an i5 4670 and a GTX 770, I am able to max the games settings with a stable 60 FPS.

The game has stunning visuals sounds, and effects. 
Gameplay wise it runs nice, combat is good as well, stealth works well. The AI seems good so far, I haven't run into any issues with them yet. The game is somewhat short, but it does offer some replayability by giving you extra missions once you complete the main one. You will definitely have hours worth of play when trying to complete the game at 100%.

This game is shorter than you might expect, but it comes with a wealth of gameplay that keeps you entertained for many hours. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC. If you're new to the MGS franchise or a hardcore veteran, you need this title in your library.

Ground Zeroes is more of a showcase of the new Fox engine and a teaser to get people pumped for The Phantom Pain than a complete standalone game.

When this game was first released, some people were upset with how short the actual mission is. However, it's priced accordingly and worth every penny you'll pay for it. I've played over a hundred hours on my PS3 and still didn't complete all the challenges.

The main mission is Ground Zeroes, but once you beat that it unlocks several other missions (some during daytime) that show just how much fun you can have on a single map.

Game is buggy.
Buy now, play later.

I haven't been able to play it all that much because the option to invert the Y-axis, simply doesn't. I've looked around for a solution that doesn't require me to install another program. I found that this game is really buggy. From small things like no audible voice audio in the opening scenes(thats as far as i got) to simply not starting.
Don't get me wrong, the game is magnificent. Despite all the bugs for keyboard/mouse the controller works for most people.
I'd tell you to buy it, it's on sale currently for nearly $13.50.
Buy it and then sit on it till the bugs are worked out. Or if you don't really care about money, wait till it's fixed and play it then. Im frustrated I can't play this game comfortably.

+
Great graphics for a open world game;
Open world (Very small area);
Great gameplay;
Outstanding voice acting as usual in a Metal Gear game;
Collectibles, like XOF patches and casset tapes;
Great use of sound and music;
Great use of lightning;
Great optimization.

-
Main story/mission is very short, 1 hour only mission at it's best; (It's a prologue to TPP);
It's an open world but just a small militar base area;
There are 6 more side ops but it's on the same small militar base area; (Only changes the weather conditions);
Some buggs, with M/K there's a scaling sensivity if you zoom in with google;
While running, Snake can't stop runnig you have to stop and then walk again;
No mouse support on the menus;
No sound options.
You can't import your custom music to the game like it does on the consoles;
No app companion for mobile devices to connect to the game like it does on the consoles.
You can't release once you grab a soldier with CQC.

Full review:

More than 10 years have passed since we had a Hideo Kojima game on the PC! Metal Gear Solid V: Ground zeroes can be short but it has top notch graphics, great gameplay, nice music, the story is good, but like the main mission it is short. 

You play as the legendary soldier Big Boss, your main mission is to rescue Paz and Chico, both are being captive on Camp Omega a Guantanamo black site, you do that by using stealth or either action moves (not advised). Other than that main mission you have 6 more side ops to do:

-Eliminate the Renegade Threat: Neutralize two targets for an unknown contact, then escape the area.
-Intel Operative Rescue: Aid in the escape of a high-value undercover operative from the base.
-Classified Intel Acquisition: Make contact with an informant, then retrieve the data and escape.
-Destroy the Anti-Air Emplacements: Destroy three AA guns to make way for a U.S. helicopter assualt.
-Deja Vu: Users sees Big Boss recreating scenes from the original Metal Gear Solid (1998).
-Jamais Vu: Drops players into the shoes of Raiden (MGS2, MGS4, Revengeance) as he investigates a very strange occurance on the U.S. base in Cuba.


 I thought my 2011 laptop wouldn't run this game but I was wrong, It can. This is with any doubts a AAA game and a really great port. If the port of The Phantom Pain will be like this one, I won't buy a desktop and more people will enjoy this masterpiece at it's fullness. Thank you for this port Kojima Productions, you won't regret porting it or any Metal Gear game for that matter.

Score: 8/10
+ Great PC port and game!
-  One short canon main story mission only in one small open world area, some minor buggs too.

13441674,76561198030014340,"[h1]Konami releases Kojima Productions' MGS's Version of Gran Turismo: Prologue[/h1]

[i]Metal Gear Solid[/i] has returned to the PC platform after a long absence since the early 2000’s release of [i]Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance[/i].  This review is specifically for the Steam membership on the fence about this product.  Whether you’re a fan of the series, don’t own one of the new consoles (PS4/XBONE), don’t own the game on a console or simply interested in the PC version.  Steam's version is for all intents and purposes the definitive experience even if others tout [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] as a “paid demo”.

People who are/were expecting a lengthy plot and story with all the twists you’re accustomed to in previous entries won’t find them here.  One could easily finish the game in 30 minutes or considerably less time should you [url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zerg-rush]Zerg rush[/url] the main mission.  Don’t fret though, there is a decent replay value if you return to do the main mission over after completion.  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is an excellent snippet of Kojima Productions and what their new Fox Engine can do.  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is the first title to utilize the engine and it has delivered well beyond my expectations on PC given the previous release on home consoles and specifically the nature of this port.  Recent releases of AAA titles previously released on home consoles from other studios to Steam have been disappointing to say the least (Square Enix.  I’m looking at you!)  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] definitely does not disappoint and allow itself to fall into a subpar port.  Kojima Productions and Konami did due diligence and has provided us with a worthy product.

	Contrasting with previous entries in the series [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] looks and feels darker, mature and tense in its execution.  Narratively the game falls pretty short and as an option you can hunt down cassette tapes to get a decent grasp as to what is going on.  There is no radar on the HUD, you can’t call a radio frequency and speak to another character ([url=http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Mei_Ling]Mei Ling[/url]!!) like in previous entries.  You still get to hear the infamous “hints” the series is known for as you begin the game during the introduction sequence.  From there on out…you are on your own to complete the mission.

	The quasi open world format provided and the optional side missions (unlocked after completing the game for the first time) provide flexibility and replay value while undertaking the main mission.  However long you choose to partake in completing the main objective.  Originally, home consoles had an exclusive (DLC perhaps?) mission pertaining to their console counterparts.  As of this writing, I’m unaware if they’ve been released to each other in today’s new global gaming market via a patch or a cash shop item from PSN/XBLA.  Steam’s release of [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] has all the extra missions from the console versions.

	Graphically, [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is stunning and the Fox Engine looks promising for the forthcoming [i]Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain[/i].  Andrew Burnes has posted an in-depth breakdown of [i]Ground Zeroes[/i]’ visual fidelity on [url=http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/guides/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes-graphics-and-performance-guide#metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes-conclusion]NVIDIA’s GeForce web page[/url].  Referencing the system requirements and fanboyism aside [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] should run on par with AMD’s offering of the comparable Intel and NVIDIA hardware components in your rig.  Regarding visual options, [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] incorporates a “shaky cam” feature by default.  Those who are prone to feel “gross” from such feature may want to turn that option off as it used pretty heavily in cutscenes and albeit to an extent during normal gameplay.  Adittionally, a few standard PC Graphics Options are missing in the menus such as AA and DoF.  Given the relative recent release of [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] and the Fox Engine one could ponder as how the engine processes AA and the like.  It’s not that bad though as game looks and performs well for my configuration (posted at the bottom).

	Overall, [i]Ground Zeroes[/i]’ release is the best of the bunch.  An XBOX 360 controller worked well and the force feedback (vibration) functioned too.  Keyboard and mouse options operated smoothly too.  So no fuss in that department.  Lastly, while off-putting for some due to the length and subjective replay value, $20 USD MSRP may not be worth it to some and their hard earned cash and it might be worth while for people purchase this title during a sale.  However, [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] was enjoyable and worthy of purchase if only to show gratitude towards Kojima Productions and Konami for doing this port justice and not tarnishing a quality title in the process.  Thereby at least giving the developers a strong response of how we accept their work.  I wholeheartedly recommend giving [i]Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes[/i] a shot even if it may not play like the fiddle you may have wanted it to be.

This review is specifically for the Steam membership on the fence about this product.  Whether you’re a fan of the series, don’t own one of the new consoles (PS4/XBONE), don’t own the game on a console or simply interested in the PC version.  Steam's version is for all intents and purposes the definitive experience even if others tout [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] as a “paid demo”.\n\nPeople who are/were expecting a lengthy plot and story with all the twists you’re accustomed to in previous entries won’t find them here.  One could easily finish the game in 30 minutes or considerably less time should you [url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zerg-rush]Zerg rush[/url] the main mission.  Don’t fret though, there is a decent replay value if you return to do the main mission over after completion.  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is an excellent snippet of Kojima Productions and what their new Fox Engine can do.  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is the first title to utilize the engine and it has delivered well beyond my expectations on PC given the previous release on home consoles and specifically the nature of this port.  Recent releases of AAA titles previously released on home consoles from other studios to Steam have been disappointing to say the least (Square Enix.  I’m looking at you!)  [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] definitely does not disappoint and allow itself to fall into a subpar port.  Kojima Productions and Konami did due diligence and has provided us with a worthy product.\n\n\tContrasting with previous entries in the series [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] looks and feels darker, mature and tense in its execution.  Narratively the game falls pretty short and as an option you can hunt down cassette tapes to get a decent grasp as to what is going on.  There is no radar on the HUD, you can’t call a radio frequency and speak to another character ([url=http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Mei_Ling]Mei Ling[/url]!!) like in previous entries.  You still get to hear the infamous “hints” the series is known for as you begin the game during the introduction sequence.  From there on out…you are on your own to complete the mission.\n\n\tThe quasi open world format provided and the optional side missions (unlocked after completing the game for the first time) provide flexibility and replay value while undertaking the main mission.  However long you choose to partake in completing the main objective.  Originally, home consoles had an exclusive (DLC perhaps?) mission pertaining to their console counterparts.  As of this writing, I’m unaware if they’ve been released to each other in today’s new global gaming market via a patch or a cash shop item from PSN/XBLA.  Steam’s release of [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] has all the extra missions from the console versions.\n\n\tGraphically, [i]Ground Zeroes[/i] is stunning and the Fox Engine looks promising for the forthcoming [i]Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain[/i].

I bought this on my ps3 when it first came out in March of 2014 and bought it on Steam again in order to have the benefit that PCs have over consoles. I enjoyed the PC version much more and I do recommend you buying this on Steam.

     It is quiet different from any other Metal Gear however this isn't a downside at all. It has improved on the downsides to previous games and made a masterpiece which is Metal Gear Solid 5.

     Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain make up MGS5 with Ground Zeroes being the prologue to The Phantom Pain. With this being said, Ground Zeroes is considerably shorter compaired to most games. With this taken into account, the price is $20 which isn't bad at all for the short but execellent build up in the story, the couple of hours that it takes to beat the main story, the few hours for the side ops. Thankfully, all of these missions have replay value in by: getting a better score, unlocking more rewards, and being able to experience the fun and intensive gameplay.

13441414,76561197970495768,"! Just a heads up, this is a pretty early review. !

I'm really impressed with Ground Zeroes and it's actually making me excited for The Phantom Pain. This is my first MGS since the second one on PS2, so I'm pretty rusty with the style of MGS games.

Performace wise everything is on high, but I have lighting at Extra High. It has run pretty dang smooth with very minimal FPS drop on my GTX 760. It does cap itself at 60 FPS though and I highly recommend vsync to be turned on. I turned it off because I don't like vsync, but you will definitely want it on. The screen tears are bad and possibly even worse than Titanfall's screen tears. This is, however, only been done in the beginning of the game where it's raining and it's at night. I don't think the daytime lighting will have any impact at all, but I've only tried one section of the game.

Again, I'm really impressed. I was actually expecting a pretty bad port, but wow... The performance optimization of this game has really surprised me. It does have it's fair share of issues (Like the controller crash, where if you have your controller plugged in at startup it crashes the game), but overall it's pretty solid.

How it Runs
The game runs nicely I keep textures at very high maxed and the rest like shadows and lighting is on high settings, sfx the one that causes the weird dof I turned off and I am getting a good 55-60fps, The game is more nvidia sided for right now as some gfx cards from the gtx are running way better on the game than amd with similar or greater specs. The game performs nicely even with my friends hd 7870 he is getting on all high settings except for the dof option which is off at a good 40-55fps.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358192946
How does it Play?
It plays pretty well, while playing with keyboard and Mouse I do have some problems running into walls which would be much easier to avoid with a analog that does full rotational 360 turns. So I would suggest to use a controller to play this game as it feels it is more playable with a controller.

How is the Story?
The story by far is pretty well, as a fan of mgs series and even to the point of buying a Ps3, psp and ps vita to play metal gear solid, I have enjoyed it right now. Im a stealth type a guy. I love the connections to the Peace Walker series
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358283342
How's the sound?
The sound is pretty epic, everything has a sound, rain drops, wind sound, foot steps and crawling. The gun sounds are pretty good but could put more realism a bit.

13441241,76561198011022058,"I'm going to preface this with: best porting I've ever seen.

Ground Zeroes is super smooth, well optimized (you might actually be able to run it with lower than specs hardware), with a lot of options for setting keybinds, graphics, indicators and much more.

Now to the game itself.
It is clearly just a preview of what The Phantom Pain aspires to become, and it excels at that. For the price tag it came out at (13.39$) it is certainly worth it if you're a fan of the series and want some hands on play before the main game comes. 
That being said, in my opinion you could use Ground Zeroes to evaluate whether you might be interested in The Phantom Pain once it comes out since the entry price is so low.

The game itself is not too short, with different missions all set in the same place at multiple times of the day. Playing this as a pure stealth game could make it last from 4 to 10 hours if you include at least some of the secondary objectives found on the map. 
S-ranking all missions might actually take you 5-8 more hours.

PROs:
- Great graphics
- Great sound
- Amazingly optimized
- Tons of content for the size of the map the game is set in
- Top notch realistic animations, easily amongst the best in the industry, which go a great way to give you the best feeling that you can find in a TPS
- Excellent porting

Having some issues with performance though. Running an R9 285 2GB and any texture setting above Low will make the game unplayble and stutter. This is the only oddity and all other settings impact performance like they should.

That being said, there are a number of additional missions (entirely seperate from the main story) which include the missions that were initally exclusive to PS4/XBONE.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES is excellent evidence of what the Fox Engine is capable of. It looks and runs great (I really need to stress how solid this port job is) , it's easy to control with both gamepad and KB/M, and what's most important is that it provides a the player with a solid stealth experience.

If you don't plan on buying The Phantom Pain, then it's going to be hard to sell you on this game since it's essentially a prequel (the final cutscene is literally a pre-rendered trailer), yet if you're not sure if you want to drop $60 on TPP, then you should consider testing out the game with Ground Zeroes.

13441101,76561198069309152,"Ground Zeroes is undoubtedly a short game - don't let this turn you off from the game itself. The game is very replayable giving the player many approaches to completing missions in any fashion you want to. Stealth mode? Engage. Gun them all down? Let's go. Shoot stun gun darts into everyone's buttox? Feel free to do so, butt you may run out of ammo unfortunately.
Metal Gear Solid has historically set the standard for stealth and difficulty, and Ground Zeroes does establish this difficulty on HARD mode. Normal mode will be a doozie for those new to the series, but when you approach everything more cautiously and begin to think about your next move, it gets more interesting. GZ Features a few different routes to take and along those routes are optional assets you can utilize. I won't spoil what, but there are some pretty cool dynamics.

Enough about the game, and onto the port itself.
+ Runs great on an i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz / gtx 770 (playing at 4K with screen filtering disabled I was able to get around 45+ FPS, at 1080p it was a solid 60 while being superior to the PS4 version)
+ Rebindable Controls 
+ Looks great even at low settings
+ Good mouse input, no noticeable Mouse-acceleration or oddities other than smoothing
+ Apparently runs well on lower end hardware


~ UI is odd at times, e.g Main Menu with no ability to guide the mouse. Instead, you have to use WASD or arrow keys to navigate, or a gamepad if you have one plugged in.
~ Small, but still a neat little feautre: No custom track imports to the game like the X360/PS3 versions (Note, Xbone and PS4 also are missing this feature)


- Cannot rebind gamepad controls, no Playstation Icons if using a PS-family pad
- No audio slider (Really, Bruh?)
- 60 frames per second cap


Solid 8/10 in my opinion, however, for those on the fence, wait to buy the game when it goes on sale for $5 or any other insanely low price that Steam offers.

It has full Keyboard+Mouse support or the 360 gamepad. 
The sound quality is amazing, same with the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job voice acting Snake. It was a little shocking at first because i'm so used to the voice of David Hayter, but i got along just fine and i believe Sutherland will live to everyone's expectation in this game and The Phantom Pain.

The game might be a little bit short but the story is pretty good (If you played Peace Walker, you will understand). Besides, the pricing is perfect and the game offers some replay value. This is just a little slice of what we are going to get in The Phantom Pain and i cannot wait for it.
I'm thankful for finally being able to play this on PC the way it was meant to be played. 9 months ago, i bought a PS4 for this game and i was about to order the game for the console, i'm so glad i've waited for the PC version.

let me tell you the postive and negative sides of this game:

+ very good graphics - maxed out on a GTX780, mostly 60 fps but dips to 46 sometimes.
+ no technical issues - no crashes, no glitches, no problems what so ever
+ very good port - like it was built for PC in the first place
+ amazing sound effects and voice acting, plus music
+ contolrs are very good - played with a xbox360 controller for the PC, no problems
+ quite interesting story

now bad parts:
-- extremely short game - im a newbie and i beat it in 115 minutes
-- very short game
-- very short game
-- very short game
-- extremely short game
-- very short game
-- very short game.

the price says it all, its a very short game. if you wanted to do the side ops, it might be longer, or if you wanted to collect all the ""collectibles""..
the game was only 3,000 MB to download, so do not expect much of a gameplay.
comparing this to Metal Gear Solid 2: SoL which was a looooong game this game is as short as a laugh.
i think the value here is only for benchmarking, otherwise even £2.00 would be expensive for it.
imo there is no replayablity, i finished the game, why would i go sneaking around again to collect some cassette tapes?
as much as i love Konami and its games, and as much as i like MGS games, i do NOT think this game WORTHS IT. not a chance.
regretably, i wasted my hard-earned money here. £11.38 is too much for this!

Yes the game (some will call it a demo) is overpriced and yes it has around the same content as that awsome, but free, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on the Playstation 2 all those years ago. But if you are a Metal Gear Solid fan I urge you to buy this game.

The game looks incredible on PC, at 1440p maxed it ran as smooth as butter with not one technical issue. The gameplay is fantastic, it's so much slicker and easier to control, but it hasn't lost the Metal Gear Solid feel. The main thing this game has done has fired The Phantom Pain up my anticipation list to somewhere near the top. Here is a list of pros and cons:

PROS:
- Superb gameplay, just like the other MGS games it feels like another level to other games of the time
- Looks amazing and is technically near flawless
- Lot's of unlocks, despite its length (side missions, weapons, etc)

CONS:
- Too short, even at a reduced price it's a bit much to ask
- It will make you desperate for The Phamtom Pain to release, you will want more!

I'm off to play through it again on hard. If the price an legth isn't something you'll get hung up on, get this game.

13440042,76561197999190369,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, a sort of ""taste of what's to come"" in MGS V: The Phantom Pain. It is not a demo however, as it has its own unique mission with save data that can be imported into the Phantom Pain. While your first story playthrough will not take very long (approximately 2 hours), the game now has a fair price tag of 13 euro's (at the time of writing). 

The game is extremely well optimized for PC, and runs very very smoothly. This is NOT a lazy port by any definition. It also has full keyboard and mouse support along with controller settings. All keys can be rebinded for both options. I'm very happy with, clearly, how much work Kojima Productions put in polishing the game, and I hope The Phantom Pain is done to the same high standard. PC gamers shouldn't find much, if anything, to complain about here.

Graphically the game looks really great to me, and it's possible to go back to the mission area at a different time of day via extra unlockable missions, which is refreshing.

The gameplay is completely different from the previous entries. Sure, it's still sneaking in third person, but shooting people in the face even if they spot you has become quite a bit easier. It features a fairly good snap-to cover system, you can take cover against virtually any wall simply by pushing into it, but not with your back turned like in previous entries. Enemies can be permanently marked via the binoculars or aiming at them. First Person mode for shooting is still in and i's possible to switch shoulders with the camera for a better view. Explosions don't immediately trigger an entire army that always knows where you are. Basically I feel the game has become easier on normal modes and far more forgiving, as newcomers will surely appreciate.

Probably the only gripe I have is the new voice, but Kiefer Sutherland does a pretty good job, it's just weird for someone like me who is familiar with the previous Big Boss.

For those of you who dont know, Metal Gear Solid has made an impact on a whole gaming genre and is THE deffinition of ""Tactical Espionage"". When PC gamers think of stealth games, what comes to mind? Dishonored? Assassin's Creed?

Fuck that shit, Metal Gear is what you want. And now, the average PC gamer can have that.

Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a short 2-3 hour game depending on how you play. That being said, no two experiences will be exactly the same. Sure, you can try to repeat your actions, but as an insane person once said, thats fucking crazy.

Metal Gear Solid V takes the linear stealth game and throws it into a new breed of stealth, open-world stealth. No, not Anus Creed, a whole new breed of it. Enemies can be anywhere at any time, so mark your targets.

MGSV is also running on Kojima's new FOX Engine, which is an incredibly incredible engine that optimizes the game to your system better than any other engine I know of. You can say Source, but Source has better physics. FOX runs great, even on a crappy laptop, you wont drop to 3 frames per second randomly when you look at a large open area.

My experience with GZ is unhealthy. Ive played it far too much and can just about get all the lines right from memory. ""Here's To You"" is stuck in my head. The game is worth replaying when youre bored or have nothing better to do, since you can play the game multiple ways.

I wont explain the story, its not that hard to follow. This is a sequel to ""MGS: PEace Walker"", but you wont be left completely in the dark.

If anything, its a tech demo, but a great one at that. Kudos to Kojima for making such an excellent game.

All joking aside, here's a list of the pros and cons:

PROS
+ Great optimization allow me to run the game at a constant 60 fps.
+ Graphics settings and controls can be customized and are plentyful
+ Keyboard and mouse controls are excellent
+ Gameplay and areas allow many strategic approaches
+ Missions are varied
+ Graphics are amazing; Wet surfaces, facial animation, high quality textures and the lighting are standout features
+ Hard difficulty is actually hard

CONS
- No custom helicopter music
- Some menus do not indicate what button to press (interogation menu)
- In these menus, using the arrow keys means letting go of the mouse, using numeric keys means you need to press three button at once, which can be a handful
- Short for a Metal Gear Solid game (although the pricing has been adapted to the length)

VERDICT
Picking up after the story of Peace Walker and building on the gameplay of MGS4, Ground Zeroes manages to add some new intense and suspenseful gameplay with well executed open areas, interesting use of weapons and a good chunk of missions to give a taste of what's to come in the next game; The Phantom Pain

Is there enough there to warrant a purchase? Well, this question has three different answers depending on what type of person you are:

1) Are you a Metal Gear fan? If so, then this game is immediately worth a purchase. There isn't a lot of story in there, but it's all worth experiencing for yourself. 

2) Are you only interested in MGSV, even though you've never played all of the previous Metal Gear games? Well, you should'nt worry then, because Ground Zeroes is a completely gameplay-driven experience after the initial 2 or so hours it'll take you to complete the main story mission. 

3) Are you only interested in the main mission? If so, then this game is only worth it if you are okay with spending the money on a 2 hours worth of gameplay. 

With that out of the way, it's worth mentioning that Ground Zeroes is a surprisingly fantastic PC port. The game always looked pretty on consoles, but the hardware-limitations kept it from reaching it's true height. Now, with sharper textures, much better draw-distance, AA, and shadows, and with the addition of depth-of-field, the game looks so much better. 

Overall, if you're interested in this game, but not sure if it'll be worth it, then I'd recommend you get it anyways. What little story is there is of the highest quality, and the missions themselves are highly replayable.

Aside from the time I've logged on Steam, I've put about 30 hours into the PS3 version of this game. First I'll address the port, and then I'll cover whether or not you should buy this game. I'll update the review if anything comes up to change my opinion of the port. 
 
First, my pertinent specs: GTX 770 2GB, i5 4690k stock speed, 8gb RAM. 
 
The port is excellent. Having made the jump from last gen console to PC, the difference in quality is enormous. I was able to max out the settings at 1080p with my modest rig with no problems. Mouse and keyboard settings are definitely serviceable. I haven't needed to rebind anything so far. My biggest complaints are the pop-in with some objects like crates and foliage, and enemies disappearing when too many are gathered in one place, or if you leave the vicinity. These issues were also present on console, but can be overlooked with the increase in draw distance and texture quality in my opinion. Finally, the menus can only be navigated with the keyboard/controller. 
 
As for whether or not you should buy this game, I can't recommend this game to every Metal Gear fan. If you're just interested in the continuation of the story, I suggest finding a story playthrough to watch online. However, Ground Zeroes is a sandbox that has a lot to offer if you're interested in learning the new MGSV mechanics, getting a taste for the capabilities of the Fox Engine, or taking apart the hints and details surrounding the game's new antagonist, Skullface. If you enjoyed the game on console and are looking for an upgrade in graphical fidelity, this game is probably worth picking up for you.

13438626,76561197970779848,"Kept you waiting, huh? 

I didn´t have to wait for Snake that long, because as a multiplatform gamer and huge MGS fan I played MGS3, 4, Portable Ops and Peace Walker on PS2/3/Portable and I also have the HD Collection for PS3. None of them where ported to PC (which is a shame!) and I also played Ground Zeroes on PS3 and then on Xbox One. 

When I heard that MGS5 Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain are coming to PC, I was worried about the port. MGS2 was not a very good port, playable, but you still felt that it was just a PS2/Xbox Port. 

But they really put some effort into Ground Zeroes. The game looks better than the PS4 version and it still runs with 60FPS on highest settings on my nearly three year old PC.

The game doesn´t crash, I don´t have any graphical bugs and the game itself works perfect. 

Mouse and Keyboard Controls are not recommended though. They work, but when you have to crawl very careful the WASD controls can be a pain in the ass. A phantom pain, but still a pain. :-)
I tried the game also with a Xbox 360 controller which worked very good, but I prefer the Xbox One controller which is IMO the best gamepad out there. 

The game itself is great, I already completed it on two consoles and if you like stealth action games you´d love this game too.
The atmosphere is very tense when you sneak through the base and with the new controls it plays very different than the other MGS games but after a few minutes you get the idea. 

Also you don´t need to know what happened in the MGS Universe to enjoy this game except for MGS Peace Walker, but there is a story recap included.
MGS3 is not THAT important (but you should play if you have the chance, my favourite MGS). It tells how the first Snake became Big Boss. 

MGS4 is the big finale of the MGS Saga and takes place after Metal Gear Solid 1+2, where you finish the story of Solid Snake. 
So don´t be confused because by the V in the title! ;) 

For the excellent port of Ground Zeroes I have to say:

If you're not already a fan of Metal Gear Solid, Ground Zeroes is not for you. Phantom Pain might be, but Ground Zeroes is not. 

This is coming from somebody whose absolute favorite game is Metal Gear Solid, and while I would normally recommend it to anybody even slightly interested in stealth-action or sci-fi games, I wouldn't recommend they start with GZ. Why?

Wwwell, Ground Zeroes is essentially a tech demo and a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V as a whole. It was released because Konami wanted to put something out alongside the release of the PS4 and Xbone, but Phantom Pain wasn't going to be ready at the time, so Hideo Kojima decided to put out what he had ready so far. That was Ground Zeroes.

The main mission, the story, is about an hour long if you take your time. Outside of that, there's a few side missions you can do which, while they're pretty unique from one another (and pretty fun, too), are mostly just there for the sake of padding. There really isn't a lot here in terms of content. It's a game that will only give you as much entertainment as the time you're willing to put into it. For people who aren't already fans of MGS, that probably isn't going to be a lot, and it's going to give them a lackluster first impression of the series.

That's one reason.

The other, which is definitely pretty biased on my part, is that the plot simply takes place at a point in the overarching story that I don't feel is really accessible to people who don't already know what's going on. It's like an interquel, almost, in that it centers around a very important character at a very important point in the grand timeline somewhere between the rest of the MGS games. If you have little to no understanding of what has happened in past games, though, you're either going to feel very lost, not very invested, or both. You're missing out on a LOT.

Bottom line, if you're interested in Metal Gear Solid, find a way to start with the older games! I recommend release order. Join me in praying that one day we'll see some PC releases of those games.

If you [i]are[/i] a fan of MGS already, however, and you haven't played this on console yet, you should! The complaint that it's really short is still very legitimate even for a fan, but as long as you understand what you're going to be getting out of it (which many people who had that complaint [i]didn't[/i]), I think it's a very, very solid prologue and a really promising look at what's to come with Phantom Pain. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is tight and refreshing, all kinds of stuff. It is a reeaally fun game. There are a lot of other reviews that'll tell you the same things and in better detail, I'm sure. 

That being said, I understand if you find it difficult to justify a $20 pricetag for a game you will mooost likely get around five hours of playtime out of. If you're not dying to play another, brand new MGS game like I was, wait around for Phantom Pain. Buy both at the same time. It'll feel just like the Tanker mission (like I'm sure it was supposed to in the first place).",1418941882,1418941882,1,0.5370919704437256,2117,234,1441083846,"{""recommendationid"": ""13437452"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197984403578"", ""num_games_owned"": 0, ""num_reviews"": 13, ""playtime_forever"": 2117, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 234, ""last_played"": 1441083846}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""Listen... listen.\n\nIf you're not already a fan of Metal Gear Solid, Ground Zeroes is not for you.

13437233,76561198025213118,"The game is phenomenal, but I'd pick it up on sale due to its length.
The main mission is short, about 1 hour, there are a few ""side ops"" that total another hour or two. The game's freedom lends to its replayability, fans of games like Deus Ex or Dishonored will see themselves replaying to try different styles and earn a higher score. If you don't fall into that category, then expect 2 1/2 hours of solid gameplay.
Gameplay wise, it's a stealth/action game, similar to Splinter Cell, with a score system that punishes you for playing the actiony side. You suffer no in-game consequences for playing it like a shooter other than it being tough as nails to deal with the amount of enemies they send at you. I can't really speak of how it compares to previous titles in the series, because I've never spent a substantial amount of time with one. The map is very open, I'd say it comes closer to the scale of the original Deus Ex than any game since, which for some will be a recommendation in and of itself.
Controls are tight, I played on keyboard and mouse, ran into few issues with it, aside from movement while prone, which is clearly deisgned with a analog sick in mind. I'd probably recommend a gamepad, unless you're allergic to them, as I am. 
Port stuff: About a million options for graphics, gameplay and controls. The game is optimized like a dream; running with a 4690k, 8Gb of RAM and a GTX 770 4Gb, I never saw the game drop below 60 on Extra High(because an Ultra setting is for squares) other than when it first loaded into the game. It's exceptional looking compared to the console version, although I would like to have seen use of PhysX or something on flags and the windbreakers guards are wearing, it looks a little funky compared to the rest of the game. No mouse control in menus for no apparent reason, probably the only real black mark through.

13437101,76561197970337241,"I've played the game pretty extensively on PS4, and so far I've checked out the port a bit. 

The game itself is excellent. It is short, true. My first time beating the main mission took about one and a quarter hours, I can now do it in substancially less than that. However the gameplay is superb, there are a half-dozen side missions which are really quite varied, and the small base is dense. There are tons of conversations to overhear, equipment to pick up and a massive amount of tactical decison making to be done. Its not like many stealth games, including previous metal gears, where you have a couple paths and you choose one, there are a large number of options, and you really feel like you are following your own path. The AI is spectacular, if you are spotted a seach party is sent out and they fan the area. If a body is found they send reinforcements and if you destory a camera someone investigates. They also don't just pace in circles like robots, which goes a long way to raising the tension in the game.

Graphically it is easily the best looking game I have seen to date. I don't play a huge assortment of AAA games so maybe there is something else out there, but this game is pretty. Plus, unlike so many recent console ports, it comes with real graphics options. The Keyboard/Mouse controls feel a little rough sometimes, (the game was definitely designed with analogue movement in mind) but are completely re-bindable. 

My only complaint is that it does feel a little short for $20 (Honestly just a little), but the length that is there is fantastic and unique and if you are a completionist there is a lot of time to be sunk into the game.

13437094,76561197970435911,"I knew exactly what to expect when I bought this game as it was released (which I think the £11 price point is great, including 33% off too, awesome!)

I have everything set to Extra High and it's running super smooth, keyboard and mouse seems to feel pretty good although I still went for an Xbox pad as I just prefer it for third person based games.

After playing my first playthrough, I'm really exciting for Phantom Pain now, if it runs as smoothly as this but features the huge open world and of course the conclusion to the story,  I shall definatly be doing several more playthroughs to get all the unlocks and do the side missions.  I think I spend 20 minutes just listening to the lore/audio logs and taking my time, with an overall completion of just under 2 hours.

This might actually be the first game i'll try and 100% complete.  Only at 8% currently, so much to do!

I've been a fan of the Metal Gear games for many years and was hoping that with the several terrible PC ports/releases this year, that Metal Gear would not fall into the same boat and happily it does not, the FOX engine seems really well optimized for PC.  Hell, it runs so well I might even be persuaded to pre-purchase Phantom Pain, something i've not done since the whole Colonial Marines debacle.

It's good to get back to a Metal Gear style game, I've missed the action sneaking for a while now, there's others like Splinter Cell but I don't know, Metal Gear always seems to have it's own charm that nothing can match.

In closing I'd recommend this to any Metal Gear fan, especially for it's current price.  Of course it's not a full game but it's not a paid demo either, there's plenty to do and yes maybe if you rush it and spoil it for yourself you can complete it in 20 minutes but that really isn't the point of this whole thing.

I was kinda worried about MGS V GZ after the requirements stated it needed 4GB of VRAM minimum a few days back (now it is 2GB minimum).

However, I couldn't resist and bought it regardless for my GTX 750 SC 1GB. And I am happy to report that on medium-high settings (except with AO turned off) at 1080p, the game runs smoothly at 60fps with nary a stutter!
Hope this info can help others!

I only tweaked my graphics settings on the menu screen before starting the game, so it is possible I could bump a couple of settings higher and still maintain 60fps!

13435327,76561197994987028,"A really 'solid' game in the series.

I've been a huge fan of the Metal Gear series since my first encounter with Metal Gear Solid 1 for the PS1, and have loved every game in the series since, even the more quirky spin-offs such as AC!D.

If you play this main mission of this game, I'm not going to sugar-coat it, it's very short, 20-30 minutes long if you rush through.

But that's not it's all about, the excellent graphics and physics provided by the FOX Engine puts this game in a league of its own, the tons of backstory provided by the hidden casette tapes and nostalgic throw backs to scenes in earlier games. You also get to play as Cyborg Raiden in Gray Fox's skin. Bad. Ass.

For a long-term fan of the series it's a very welcomed addition to the family, the extra missions are challenging and refreshing, especially if you're going for an ""All S"" playthrough!

I've sunk 40 odd hours into this game on the PS4 version, collecting all the extras and playing through every mission to S rank them all.

For hardcore fans of the series, look out for the mission 'Déjà Vu', you're going to love it!

Thank you, Hideo Kojima, I look forward to TPP!

Time and replayability:

Took me roughly 2 hours to finish the game, which consisted of me completing only the main objective and rescuing a few POWs. That in itself is a large downside to the game, but there's defiantly replayability here, you unlock many different side objectives when playing through the game. Plus, when you beat it for the first time, the hard difficulty is unlocked. However, if the idea of replaying the same area over and over with variations (being time, weather, enemy patrols and objectives) is off putting, you may want to hold out on this.

Story:

 People like myself jumping into the game without playing much MGS (I've only played snake eater) will have no idea whats going on but there are explinatons in game. The main one, called ""backstory"" in the menu, briefly recalls the events leading up to GZ and does it very well. There are also tapes that you can listen to so you can fullly understand characters motivations. Very good story.

The Port:

In regards to the PC port, it's excellent.
I'm running a 3 or 4 year old rig, (CPU: Phenom II 955 and GPU: 6870(1GB)) and the game runs very well, despite the games min requirements being a 4GB (I think this has now been changed to 2GB). I get 45-60fps with everything on high except one or two things on medium. You can also alt-tab the game without it breaking and the keys can be rebound. Unfortionatly though, the menus are not mouse driven, you have to use arrow keys and enter to navigate through them. That however isn't a big issue for me, just a minor complaint. There are some very minor and slightly annoying bugs. But they do not effect the overall game experiance and will easily be patched out.



This is an excellent game if you like stealth games, solid gameplay and performance. However, the length and the replayability for the price will put people off. Perhaps it should have been sold at $10 instead.

Everything else about the menus, however, is mostly excellent. Easily one of the better console->pc ports. You get a plethora of options to adjust, including pretty much all the graphical options you would expect from a pc title. Much kudos for that. Additionally, I very much enjoyed the inclusion of the granular control over aim sensitivity that allows you to adjust third person, over the shoulder and first person aiming sentivity individually on top of horizontal and vertical sensitivity being separately adjustable. It also seems like all the player controls are rebindable. Couldn't find anything for tweaking menu controls, though I haven't checked ini/cfg files yet. In summary: Menus are excellent and full-featured, but the menu controls themselves are less than stellar, in particular the iDroid menus.

Graphically the game looks pretty good. Not sure how much/if any upgrades are done over the ps4/xbone versions, but it looks decent. Much more importantly, however, is the optimization. While being only able to speak from a sample size of one, namely my own computer, I would say it's a really well optimized port job. Running on an i7 2700k at stock speeds and a gtx580 the game runs beautifully at 1920x1080 with all options maxed out except SSAO which I left at the second best option. Haven't tried maxing it, so for all I know that too might run fine. The overall framerate isn't the highest in the world with my specs, but there is very little microstutter so it remains perfectly playable and doesn't strain the eyes.

I did notice some slight stuttering as the game was loading assets when zooming the binoculars or when quickly panning the camera, but it wasn't too bad and after moving the game install onto an ssd that is almost entirely eliminated. Overall it's perfectly acceptable. Load times very pretty good both on raid-0 mechanical drives and the ssd, though obviously the latter helped significantly.

The only downside I can really point out that I've noticed so far is a minor annoyance with the binoculars. Even after dropping first person view sensitivity to the lowest setting, the aim speed with binocs is far far too high, especially as you start zooming in. I'd love to see a hotfix address this.

It will take about 8 hours to complete if you take your time (trying to be stealthy) first time I played the main mission it took about 4 hours as I liked exporing the base. There is plenty of scope for emergent gameplay depending on how you react to getting into trouble. 

The side missions are all pretty good with each offering something different and even the change from day to night makes a difference to the gameplay by taking away your shadowed hiding spots but it also serves to make the base feel fresh after many hours in the dark.

If you're the kind of player who wants to rush from point A to point B then I would wait for big price drop, if your the kind of player that likes to savour the game and explore every nook and cranny and find all the hidden (disturbing) story tapes and hidden weapons then this is for you. Oh yeah the graphics are simply beatiful, with some nice resolution options as long as your rig has the muscle. The shadows, light and textures are also petty good, the animations are fluid and the control is extemely responsive on both keyboard/mouse and controller.

Right off the bat I saw the minimum specs were a 2GB GPU and a i5. I have a 400 dollar Asus laptop with the following specs. Overclocked AMD A8 4500m APU, 8GB of ram, windows 8.1 64 bit and a 750GB HDD. While that is way below the specs koami is asking for I took the plunge and was hoping that well if a old xbox 360 can run it then it wouldn't hurt to try. To my surprise I was right that the specs were not correct but here's the catch. It seems like the minimum specs are for a solid 60FPS. My target was 30 just like the last gen consoles but with DX11 graphics at native 720p and not upscaled. I left vsync enabled since its not too demanding or badly coded in this game. textures low, model detail on medium, SSAO enabled on high, lighting on high, texture filtering on medium, shadows on low, did fullscreen mode and not boarderless fullscreen too. Now here's the catch. When I set screen filtering to anything higher then low it caused huge FPS drops. I noticed that feature controls AA, depth of field and motion blur. With that setting on low I was getting between 25-32FPS during gameplay which is still better then last gen since they dropped to a locked 20FPS all the time and sometimes dip into the teens. All in all you do not need crazy specs to play this game if you are willing to tweak the settings and accept 30FPS.

This game is no different from any other Metal Gear, the gameplay was improved, it's more fluid and feels more realistic.
The main mission is indeed only 2 hours long but you have other missions, which will take a LOT of time to master, even the main mission in hard requires more concentration than in easy. The AI is smart, they will see you at least 100m afar and will report when they are going to check it, and when they finish, they'll report it again.
Kiefer Sutherland absolutely smashes it as Big Boss, I loved David Hayter but it's nice to freshen up the series.
Having in account this port is made by japanese people, this is an excellent port, a lot of graphics options and the controls are smooth even with mouse and keyboard.
I only don't understand why they refer to Boss as Snake, due to the fact that in the end of MGS 3 he was promoted to Big Boss and in Peace Walker they refer to him as Boss during the game.

Inifiltrate Camp Omega, as Snake aka Big Boss. Can you make it out alive in one piece?

Experience the amazing prologue chapter of MGSV experience, Ground Zeroes. It begins the story of ""V"" and will continue in the much larger part The Phantom Pain, which releases in 2015. The story will show us how Big Boss becomes the man, that threatens the entire world. The ""villain"" gamers knew him as in the very first game of the saga, Metal Gear (released in 1987).

PROS
-Big Boss.
-PC release with good port.
-Ground Zeroes changed the usual MGS gameplay a lot. From linear gameplay to open world style and it works very well. 
-No Soliton Radar, which makes sneaking very intense and cool.
-New UI etc. 
-Movement is very smooth.
-Amazing graphics and weather effects thanks to Fox Engine.
-New voice for Snake, Kiefer Sutherland. Some dislike the change, but I love Kiefer's voice too.
-Bonus missions and lots of replayability, challenges etc.

CONS
-Story mission is pretty short, but on the first time it can take a while.
-No traditional codec calls, as in previous MGS games. But I'm sure we get to hear the characters talk a lot in TPP.

Ground Zeroes is awesome and makes you instantly want to see what happens next in Game Of The Century, The Phantom Pain.",1418927783,1419017217,1,0.7408760786056519,1809,170,1441046632,"{""recommendationid"": ""13433121"", ""author"": {""steamid"": ""76561197981776655"", ""num_games_owned"": 526, ""num_reviews"": 111, ""playtime_forever"": 1809, ""playtime_last_two_weeks"": 0, ""playtime_at_review"": 170, ""last_played"": 1441046632}, ""language"": ""english"", ""review"": ""\""Here's To You\""\nInifiltrate Camp Omega, as Snake aka Big Boss.
